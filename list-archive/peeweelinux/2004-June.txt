Subject: [Peeweelinux] Custom Kernel Configurations
Message-ID: <20040606164800.90741.qmail@web14003.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello, I'm new to peewee so forgive this basic
question:

I'm having trouble getting a custom compiled kernel to
appear in my project file-system. I compiled a new
kernel from the pwlconfig interface and saved it as a
new packege. After doing so the screen says to "select
the custom kernel in the package selection to include
it in your project". In the "configure project file
sytem" menu I see a category for "kernel" as well as
"custom kernel". I see my custom kernal available, but
when I select it and extract the file system my
/mnt/boot directory is empty (I'm expecting to see
bzImage). I only get bzImage in the /boot directory
when I choose one of the existing kernels like
"kernel-basic-2.2.17".

Again, sorry if this is a stupid newbie question.

Message-ID: <40D74C18.3040301@ecofor.cl>

I need to change some of my old Geode boards with some new VIA chipset 
Panel PC's and I was completely unable to make the video card work with 
my original development.

I only needs a generic 640x480 at 8 bits, but I'm using the 2.2.17 
kernel in original PeeWee 6.1 (which I use long time ago), so I didn't 
have framebuffer support.

I have tried to make work the RedHat 6.2 in this machine and it won't 
work neither.

I will appreciate some ideas to reduce the changes needed for this 
system. Is a generic Taiwanese machine.

I only get a 320x200 resolution.

Thanks in advance,

Best regards,
                Cristián.
