Message-ID: <3AC9AAA5.20742901@undoo.com>

Alright, RH 6.1 system on 2.2.18 kernel.

[root@coral Embedded_Build]# ./pwlconfig -n dpn
Error: -n:  not a valid pwlconfig option 

[root@coral Embedded_Build]# ./pwlconfig

Pee Wee Linux System Configuration - Version 0.61.0
Error: No Project

bash$ rpm -qa | grep curses
ncurses-4.2-25
ncurses-devel-4.2-25
ncurses3-1.9.9e-9

So, either the docs are wrong or pwlconfig doesn't work.
The only options it seems to know about are -n, -b and
-h. Putting the project name on the command line, sans
-n option, generates the same error.

Did I miss something here? And where are docs for doing
this by hand, since I would actually like to know?

Hi,

Are you running pwlconfig as root? It sounds like you don't have
permissions to create the proper files...

> Alright, RH 6.1 system on 2.2.18 kernel.

That's what it's being developed on and tested on.

The docs aren't very helpful there have been many changes sonce the docs
were done...

I was wondering if anyone has upgraded the XFree86 support to the 4.0.3 or
later
and been successful with supporting the Intel 815 chipset video?   I'm about
to
attempt this and if it has been done already I'd be interested in hearing
your
findings...

Thanks,

Randy

Hi, 

As far as I know XFree86 does not work woth I815 boards. 
This has nothing to do with PeeWeeLinux kernel settiongs, it
is a known problem. 

I might be wrong, so I would like to hear from you if you have
an X solution.

After looking at the driver status notes on XFree86.org, you are correct.
It
supports the 810, but apparently not the 815 officially.  However, I have 
spoken to someone claiming that if you had the 810 support, then the 815
would also work.  I have yet to see that work myself though.  I'll let you
know if I can find out anything further.
