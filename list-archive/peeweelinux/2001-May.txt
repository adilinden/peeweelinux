Subject: i815 video support with PeeWeeLinux?
Message-ID: <EE3F7DF79AC85C4BA49A999C8D016A04011E13BD@ausxmbrh06.aus.amer.dell.com>


Ok, as an update I was able to get 16-bit 1280x1024 out of an i815 
on board video system with XFree86 4.0.3, despite it not being
listed as supported in their driver status notes.  This was on a 
RedHat 7.0 host system, not the PeeWeeLinux [0.61.0] target which
doesn't inherently have 4.0.3 support in it.  I'm going to tackle
getting the right stuff in the target package next...

Here are the relevant lines from XF86Config:

Section "Device"
	Identifier "Intel Corporation|82810E CGC [Chipset Graphics
Controller]"
	Driver	"i810"
	BoardName	"Unknown"
	VideoRAM	8192
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier "Screen0"
	Device "Intel Corporation|82810E CGC [Chipset Graphics Controller]"
	Monitor "My Monitor"
	DefaultDepth   16
	Subsection	"Display"
		Depth	16
		Modes "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
	EndSubsection
EndSection

Hi,

Thank you for sharing the solution you found regarding RedHat 7.0. I
forwarded your email to the PWL list as well for reference.

I am currently spending what little spare time I have left at building a
secure webserver to replace my aging server in place now. Once that has
been accomplished I will be looking at more PeeWeeLinux development.
Unfortunately I am left with very little time these days...

TTYL,
Adi

As an aside, the reason that gcc 2.96 is not able to compile some stuff is
because technically there is no gcc 2.96. See the GNU site here:

 http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc-2.96.html

Basically, 2.96 is development code working towards 3.0. (2.97 falls into
this category too) The most recent formal release of gcc is 2.95.2.

I am using pwlconfig to create my distribution and it works fine except one
thing. I can extract and use package bundled with Pee Wee but cannot use RPM
bundled with Red Hat 7.1 or 6.2 (ex: Kernel or wu-ftpd packages).  When I
choose Nothing appears in the "RPM Package Extracted" window but it's wrote
100%. If there is a problem with this feature, is it possible to extract the
package with another tool (Ex: RPM) in the package directory and use it?

Hi, 

There is an issue with the rpm package included with redhat 6.2. The
script portion that invokes rpm requires that rpm returns the group 
defined in the source rpm for the package to be placed in the proper
'packages' subdirectory. The redhat 6.2 rpm would respond with the group
stored in the system database which is different from what I've used for
PeeWeeLinux. So if you use the rpm supplied with RedHat 7.x quite possibly
the layout of the packages dir isn't what you'd expect. pwlconfig should
still work but it'll break compatibility with saved configuration plus
nest the actual tar file quite deeply.

The rpm proven to work can be found in Embedded_Build/bin...

TTYL,
Adi

Hi,

I tried to install RPM files not included in pee wee linux using pwlconfig
and RPM version 3.0.3 (included with Red Hat 6.1) and it's still doesn't
work. So, the problem seem to be something else than the RPM version. I
tried some packages from Red Hat 6.0, 6.1, 6.2 and 7.1 and the problem still
the same (no file is extracted but no error, write 100%). Is the package
included with pee wee linux come directly from Red hat 6.1? Is there
something I can do to use package not included with pee wee?

Hi,

The packages included with PeeWeeLinux are custom build for PeeWeeLinux.
Some are modified Redhat rpms but most are build from scratch. I haven't
had a chance to try PWL with any of the recent distributions (i.e. RH7.1)
myself. I am travelling for the next 2 weeks but hope to get some time to
test this regardless.

TTYL,
Adi

Subject: Can RPM still be used in this situation?
Message-ID: <D973CF70008ED411B273009027893BA401BE6AF7@irv-exch.phoenix.com>

I've been using the PeeWee Linux distribution to create a Linux file system.
The end result for me is a tar file with all of the files necessary to boot
and run Linux.  This works fine, but now I'm faced with the problem of
providing updates.  RPM has a lot of capabilities that make it useful in my
situation (PGP/GPG signatures, pre-,post-install scripts, etc.) but one big
problem is that the RPM database is empty.  I can manually create the
database with the rpm --initdb command, but since the database doesn't know
about any of the already installed files I usually get failed dependency
errors when I run rpm -i.  I understand why, but the question is how to best
fix this?  Would it be possible to add the current files to the RPM database
at some point so that new updates would work correctly?  Any thoughts would
be appreciated.
