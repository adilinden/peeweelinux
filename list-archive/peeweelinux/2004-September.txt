Subject: [Peeweelinux] Seeking advice for FTP or SMB server for embedded linux
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0409141104100.18851-100000@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

I'm working with an embedded Linux system and need to add the ability to
accept downloaded files from elsewhere. Ideally, I'd provide a Samba server,
so that Windows users will have a familiar experience, but I'm not sure what
issues come up in installing a full Samba server on a small embeded system
(I'm running out of a 128MB CF card). I've done a bit of searching to find
a minimal Samba server, and failed on that. 

The best I could hope for would be that someone can point me to a minimal
Samba server, or a HOWTO to accomplish that.

Failing that, I will simply provide an FTP server and instruct my Windows users
to use FTP. Is there a FTP server designed for small embedded systems? The
popular FTP servers, wu-ftpd and vsftpd seem rather heavy handed, and I certainly
don't need the fancy features provided by vsftpd.

I welcome any advice or suggestions you may have.

Personally, I would start with ProFTPd -- in theory it should be easy to 
get working and have a pretty small footprint, on top of being able to 
decouple it from the system-based authentication and use virtual logins.

Might be easiest to hit http://rpm.pbone.net and search for .src.rpm 
files for RedHat 6.x and 7.x, tearing them apart to look at compile 
options. Given that, it should take only an hour or two to roll your own 
and make a custom PWL package...
