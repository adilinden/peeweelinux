<PRE>Hi David,

&gt;<i> I would rather use an uncompressed filesystem (I know this adds some
</I>&gt;<i> confusion), as I want to be able to save configuration changes and new
</I>&gt;<i> files, etc... I do not know how the compressed disk is made, or how I would
</I>&gt;<i> edit a particular file within the compressed disk... Anyways...
</I>
pwlconfig has an option available which will create 2 partitions on the 
target device, a bootable  FAT partition with kernel and an ext2 partition 
with an uncompressed filesystem which is copied into a RAM disk at boot 
time. This option should work with the DOC.

&gt;<i> I am running pwlconfig from an HDD (/dev/hda) on the Wafer board with the
</I>&gt;<i> DOC. I can mount and the pwlconfig works just fine.
</I>
I have never tried running pwlconfig on the same platform as my target, so 
I never attempted to actually have pwlconfig load a filesystem onto an 
attached DOC. I always used the intermediate step of loading a CF and 
moving files from it to the DOC once its running on the target system.

&gt;<i> Can you set the target device as /dev/msys/fla1? How id your syslinux.cfg
</I>&gt;<i> file setup? Does it somehow load that doc.b or something?
</I>
I think /dev/fla or /dev/msys/fla should work. pwlconfig works on the 
complete target device, not a single partition. It will use fdisk and 
filesystem tools to prepare and load the device.

&gt;<i> What should the root= parameter be set to in the syslinux.cfg?
</I>
Not sure, it's been a while since I manually tweaked syslinux.cfg. 
pwlconfig should do all that for you...

&gt;<i> I am a little lost when it comes to syslinux. I was just so impressed at how
</I>&gt;<i> easy it was to do with CF, that this DOC system is almost making me cry :(.
</I>
Yup, been there, done that. In my opinion getting DOC to support an ext2 
filesystem to boot from is nothing short of a nightmare. I would avoid 
that scenario at all costs. Keeping the bootpartition FAT and using 
syslinux should be quite doable and fairly easy to reproduce once 
succeeded.

BTW, I think you had asked me to be added to the PWL mailing list. I just 
added you manually. Hope this is ok.

Adi
