peewee doesn't by default create the X link

either create it yourself, or just launch the X server executable
(XF86_SVGA, for example)

  I have exactly same problem , does any one have any solution ??

  did u solve it David ??

  Hello,

  I'am trying to use the PeeWeeLinux on an embedded platform. I have =
  downloaded the ISO distribution and make a configuration with PWLCONFIG =
  for my target platform. All the boot and initialisation are OK and i can =
  login and enter the password. But when i tryied to start the W server =
  the next message appear:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------=
  ---------------------------------
  execve failed for /usr/X11R6/bin/X    (errno 2)
  _X11TransSocketUNIXConnect: can't connect: errno =3D 111
  giving up
  xinit: connection refused (errno 111): unable to connect to X server
  xinit: No such process (errno 3): server error
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------=
  ---------------------------------

  I don't know what happened, and i would like to know why the X server =
  don't start.
  Are there missing some files, packages on my PWLCONFIG configuration ?
  Is it a reported bug ?

  Would you be so kind to help me on this problem because i would like to =
  use Xfree86. I would like to use a graphic interface to run an =
  application made with FLTK lib or QT lib.

  Best regards

  David ROCHE

Hi

   This is a basic Linux question.  We are using Peewee Linux on a PC104
box.

   From the console port I can su to any account including root.

   I can telnet to the PC104 box and su to any account except root.

   When telnet in and then su to root it prompts for password and then
responds with
   su:incorrect password  --> after a couple of seconds of delay.

   I removed the root password and still get the same results from
telnet (ie it still looks for a password).  From the console the no
password account works find.

   I tried adding ttyp(n) to the /etc/securetty file : no change

   Any other suggestions?

   Thanks for the help in advance.

I don't know if this is useful or not:

1). You should check to see whether /dev/mouse is defined in your dev 
directory and take a look at your XF86Config file (which, incidentally you 
should post so that we can take a look at it). In particular there is a 
section that tells you which port the device is set up on. Is that defined 
correctly? 2). You should also post what kind of mouse you have. Pee wee 
is set up for some, but not all of the stuff that's out there. I'm 
currently trying to figure out how to recompile the X server, and if I 
succeed I'll post some info on how to do it, in the event that your 
hardware does not have drivers for it.

X can be very frusteration to get going, but it also usually comes down to 
one or two lines of code.

Hi everyone,
Can any one supply any example image with running X on peewee, its been long
time and many hours I am trying to get X with peewee. At last I got X
working but I have to block the mouse for that so it is of no use.

1) I installed peewee with X libs and Xserver
2) I use redhat 7.1 now , I was using Mandrake 8 before
3)I copy some file from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 like keyboard layout and server
policy
4) I copy XF86Config to /etc/X11

what I am getting if I don't bock mouse when running XF86_SVGA has
Can not open mouse(no device found)
Fatel error
than I have blocked  mouse by  AllowMouseOpenFail
and yes I am getting a graphical screen and a cursor in the centre but of no
use as I can not use mouse.
I have spend a hell of time after Xwindows on peewee, if some one can really
help me on this,
I would be appreciate if Adi you can send me some really good information
rather than just suggestions.

please explain step by step in detail that how to configure the X on peewee,
I really need that actually other wise things does not seems working easily
on Linux

Please Help

I'm not quite sure but maybe you have a ps2 mouse and the XF86Config (or 
the /dev/mouse) points to a serial port or vice-versa.

if you have a ps2 configured mouse X won't start unless it can actually talk
to the mouse.

if you configure a serial mouse it will start even if it can't find the
mouse

 It was same stuation in my linux box.
 Try to remove check the [tinylogin] in the  [Confiure Project File
System->System_Minimal] of the peewee program, if you use original
linux system utils.
 It was solved by the above-mentioned method in my box.
....muuu.... seem to be the confliction of the secure system between
tinylogin.and original linux utils.

yes, I also had this problem, and some similar problems with busybox.
also some busybox utils don't implement all the funcionality to run scripts
they're used on (for example to start java 1.3).
if you're not that short on space drop the tiny/busy stuff.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Peeweelinux and DOC Millenium
Message-ID: <BFEEKKDCDMDCHHDDFMBEMEPBCAAA.adfernandez@gmv.es>

Hi all,

I have a diskonchip Millenium installed on my redhat 6.2 system and I can
access it with no problems (I used the driver 5.1.4 from M-Systems ).

My problem is when I tell the pwlconfig to load the file system onto Target
(/dev/msys/fla) it seems to copy all files untill it gets to the lilo part
and then it fails. I have tried copying all the file and changing the doc.b
and doc-lilo but it still does not work.

I wonder if you would be so kind to help me with this problem.

Thanks
Adrian

I don't have a ton of experience with the disk-on-chip filesystems, but a 
common problem that people have at that stage is that the kernel is either 
not built or not built properly. I would check under your 
projects/whatever_yours_is_called/mnt/boot directory to see whether or not 
you have one, a map file, etc. before getting fancy...

It's been about two years but I have been using the lilo that M-systems
provided with no problem.

Message-ID: <OE30kouI5BrxJuLpTkm0000137a@hotmail.com>

Hi , all
thanks for your overall support.

I have managed to get the X working with you ppls help, now my major task is
here and if I solve that I am done.

I am using QT/X11 for development on my mandrake 9 machine with glibc 2.2.5
and 2.4.19 kernel. My QT application is working fine with all my dynamic
libraries.

I just want this application to run on my peewee, with or without Window
manager ( I know I will be needing some window manager if I want to use my
same application source which is QT issue).


I tried to copy all the linked libraries of my application to peewee. and
its not supported and giving errors when booting.

most of them says lib.so. version GLIBC_.2.2 not found and bla bla
............:(

Now I have decided to update the version of glibc libraries by installing
2.2.5 glibc rpms on my peewee. As peewee is with glibc 2.1.3.

What do u ppl suggest.

1)I don't think , If I change the glibc 2.1.3 RPM with 2.2.5 rpm in the
Embedded Linux /rpm folder than  peewee will accept and install 2.2.5
2)if not than I can do rpm -xvf  glibc 2.2.5 ............... or do i need to
update it step by step with other older versions of glibc
3)and the last solution can be, if I install older Linux , older  QT like
1.4 or some thing and change some codes in my application as it is of QT
3.X( that's too much work :) )

4) unfortunately I am not able to compile QT statically even if I can I
don't think it will work with older glibc



need your suggestions and help.

Also Adi I would be pleased if I can help you any how to improve peewee
(else than financially ;) )

thanks for your help , waiting for you suggestions

You don't need to compile QT. You just need to compile your app statically. This way it will include the qt libraries and work with any glibc.

Message-ID: <2.2.16.20030117142238.a857ef2e@zmicro.com>

I'm not sure of your question or your procedure.

The .iso file is meant to be transferred to a CD-ROM.  Then you
can install peeweeLinux.   If you can't make a CD you can
still mount the iso on the loop device to make it look like
a CD.  But you can skip all that and download the tar.gz
package and install from that instead.

PeeWeeLinux is not an embedded system.  It is a tool you 
use to build an embedded system.   The tool is what
you get when you cd_install.  To start PeeWeeLinux
you type ./pwlconfig

You don't actually need rh6.2 unless you start compiling
your own programs.  And even then you may not need it.

Hi

   I am trying to interface to a quad uart card which uses TI's
TL16C754B 64 byte fifo uart.  I have verified that the card is set up
correctly (after the open I manipulate the device registers for now) but
still not able to communicate.   I created the device file using
setserial with uart 16750.

   I can open the device but a write never seems to send data to the
UART.  I enabled the debugging prints.  When I close the device I get
transmission of data from the UART but it looks like random data.

Any suggestions?  Is this a path to an end?

thanks
jim

On the 16C554 uarts we use (4port Advantech PCM-3643) there are some dip 
switches that caused problems. One of them was labeled "98/NT Mode" 
which has to be *off*. The other problemo was getting all the dips for 
the IRQ/base address right so as not to interfere with other serial 
devices on the mainboard.

Once I got those nailed, using setserial was my friend and everything 
started to work, e.g.:

/usr/bin/setserial -v /dev/ttyS4 uart 16550A port 0x240 irq 9
/usr/bin/setserial -v /dev/ttyS5 uart 16550A port 0x248 irq 9

You are looking for a RTOS. PeeWeeLinux is simply a standard linux embedded distribution (or target builder, however you look at it). 

I have used PeeWeeLinux successfully with RTAI and RTLinux compiled kernels that allow for Deterministic hard realtime. Check out  www.rtai.org  for more info. After learning RTAI you can build an embedded image with Peewee.

Thanks for your answer.

Yes, I'm looking for a RTOS. The company who provide my old RTOS is
definitivily dead ! :-)

so, I try to see real time evolution of Linux. A kind of Linux RTOS could be
ok for my application.

But every RTAI or RTLinux works with separate scheduler. I try to find a
real linux embedded distribution
with the preemptible patch ( maintened by Robert Love ) and the low latency
patch.

I think, it should be enought for me.

But I can't find it.

I have found one today, is Timesys Linux GPL. But it's not the official
preemptible patch.
But I will try this one.

Why don't you try to make a peeweelinux with thoses patches ?

no, I don't think there are real-time concerns on peewee.

that has happened to me twice in advantech hardware, once because of a
broken computer and the other because of a problem with CF that I still
can't understand. (search the list for my posts regarding problems with CF)

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Problems with file transfer in compact flashes:
Message-ID: <DLEBLAHEFMHDDFHFIABEEEFOCAAA.tibo@fic.com.br>

I’m trying use peeweeelinux to create a compact system  and I intend to use
it  in small computers. (thin clients). These computers are using compact
flash cards instead of hd. When I try to transfer the peeweelinux files to
the flashes, I receive a script error message, with lines such like these:

 “ Editing inittab…failed
    Idconfig: can’t open directory /usr/x11rb/lib no such file or directory
     Can’t create temporary cache file /etc/id.so.cache no such file or
directory
    Open ./mnt/bzimage :no such file or directory”

All these lines were copied from the script log file.
I would appreciate very much if someone could help me with this issue.

I  created a bootable flash card with PeeWeeLinux but the system starts in
 the login screen. I don't know how to configure the users or the root
 aconunt and passwords. I think it may be an file system option, but I can't
 find out a way to configure it..



Thanks for your help.

Look in ${PWL}/packages/System_Base/, the "util-linux" package. 
Basically, untar util-linux.tar, edit the etc/passwd and associated 
files, and retar them back up.

Make sure to "Extract Filesystem for project" again to repopulate the 
'built' filesystem before transferring to flashdisk...
