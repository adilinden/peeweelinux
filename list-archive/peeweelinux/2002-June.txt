yes, I include the jdk directory in the custom files of peeweelinux.
I'm going to explore the possibility of including it as a RPM, but I didn't
test that yet.

One issue is that on version 1.3.x the script that launches the JVM depends
on head, cut and other unix tools (they are included in peewee).

If you use version 1.4, those issues don't happen (I'm using 1.3.1_03).

Another issue is libnsl. This is necessary to run java, and isn't included
in peewee, so you have to add it as a custom file. the library version of
recent distributions (GBLIC2_2) is different from peewee (GBLIC2_1), so you
probably won't be able to copy it from your desktop, but at least in RH7.2
there's a directory with compatibility libs and you can just copy it from
there.

In terms of speed, I haven't run many tests yet, but I don't think it will
be very slow. Running from ramdisk would be a good choice, but with JDK at
+50M, that would leave little ram for your programs...

One issue I'm pursuing is that I want to mount the filesystem readonly,
would that interest you ?

Another thing I'm trying to do is to use ext3, but for that I'm going to
have to use another kernel. (if the above option works, I'm not going to
follow this one, of course).

Hope you keep in touch, as I haven't found a lot of people interested in
embedded java...

Hi Ricardo,

Cool!  Our device is booting (yay!), now it's on to even more fun stuff.
  Do you have a methodology for installing the jvm, and where do you put
your code?

I was thinking of formatting and mounting sda3 (rest of CF card) as
/opt, and putting the JVM and our code over there.  See any downsides to
that?  Is it too slow to run right off CF, and should I be installing it
with PeeWee, and having it load into ramdisk?

thx,

Snippet from a bug report I did on the 1.4 series:

    "... Also, I believe this issue will not be fixed as the future
     releases of JDK i.e. 1.4.x and higher will be compiled on 586
     platforms i.e. minimum requirement would be a pentium."
                     - Girish.Manwani@sun.com (

I suggest you learn another language - you could be investing in a
technology that will leave you in the lurch.  This is a problem for
the managers to resolve, but I think Java might be a poor solution.
There are non-Sun implementations of Java/JVM, but at various stages
of readiness.

I occasionally use Java on a 486/66 with 16 Mb ram, and found it
not a particularly pleasent experience - lots of swapping required.

I would tend to disagree about embedded Java.  I know there is interest 
in it.  Where I work we are very interested in it.

FWIW, we've had good luck so far with Java on the Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 PDA 
(16MB Flash, 64MB RAM, Linux based!).  

The JVM is Insignia's "Jeode" -- not full-blown Java, but "PersonalJava" 
compatible.  Supposedly, this only requires ~4MB ROM, and 2-4 MB RAM.  
Doesn't seem to have an open-source / GPL license.

I also have an Arcom board (300 MHz Geode/16M flash/64M ram) that supports 
the IBM J9 VM.  This also doesn't seem to be GPL.

Does anybody know of a GPL embedded Java effort?  Maybe a "Peewee Java"?? ;-)

Aha!  Very good, I had thought I needed to rebuild an entire glibc-2.1 
in order to get this, but I'll just try grabbing it from a RH62 
compatible set of libraries. Nice tip, thanks!

I'm actually going to do the same -- try and build a 2.4.18 kernel with 
ext3 and 'emlog' support.  I am going to start that today, trying to 
figure out how to get it to integrate into peeweelinux build system 
(anyone have any pointers?)

> Hope you keep in touch, as I haven't found a lot of people interested in

We're workin on it!  Right now we're trying different JDKs (sorta), 
there's this nifty micro-java called 'Wonka' that's being tested by the 
coding crew.  But, if I can get that libnsl working, maybe we can go 
back to IBM JDK 1.3 instead....

I mentioned this in my other post -- we're evaluating it right now

need 8 port support!).

Mainly because they have this nifty serial package that would support 
all kinds of stuff -- our particular project requires reading from 5-7 
serial ports to gather data, and spit it back out (upstream) via PPP or 
ethernet.  So, the initial research made them stick out (and, a much 
smaller footprint?)

> 	what's emlog ?

It's this "fake" /var/log/messages subsystem.  Basically, 
/var/log/messages is actually a device node, and you insmod emlog.o on 
bootup (you have to build it into your kernel, the options for emlog are 
present in the "stock" 2.2.17 kernel provided by PWL).  What happens is 
that it uses some sort of buffered, circular "last process only" stuff 
(I'm not sure 100% the details), so that /var/log/messages is never a 
real file, and therefore can't fill up your ram filesystem! tada. ;) 
Very cool....

Message-ID: <3CFD4C2F.7030506@fluid.com>

Has anyone gotten a 2.4 kernel to boot with peewee?  I've built all 
sorts of custom packages with the new kernel (modutils, etc), but on 
boot I am getting an inability to mount the root partition:

Copying filesystem /dev/hdc2 to /dev/ram2...
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k block-major-22, errno = 2
/dev/hdc2Flushing buffers to disk...
tcsetpgrp: Inappropriate ioctl for device
kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 01:02

The cause seems straightforward(?), but /sbin/modprobe is there and 
should be working...?  Anyone seen this before?

thx!

Hi Troy,

Thanks for the embedded Java (Wonka) link.  

I've had 2.4.18 working with Peewee and a DiskOnChip Millennium, although I 
didn't use modprobe.  I found it much easier to build everything I needed 
into the kernel, instead of using modules and/or initrd.

Cool Mark, hope it works! (wonka)  I *think* the guys did a field test

Hmmmmmmmm on 2.4.18 -- well, can you even begin to guess what it's 
trying to modprobe for?  ext2 is built in, only ext3 is outside.  I do 
have to build ppp as modules (can't remember why, read it somewhere?) 
but I could go back and build a monolithic kernel.

I didn't follow all of your discussion, but I think that if you have ext3 fs
root, you must have ext3 in the kernel, not in a module, because it can't
mount the fs to load the module... I think

FYI only -- building the 2.4 kernel with no modules (all internal) did 
the trick, my ext3 partition mounts, emlog loads, ppp/eth0 still work 
and everything.

I had to build a whole bunch of stuff in a neato way for a 2.4 kernel 
that was uber easy to integrate -- if anyone is interested, gimme a 
holler and I'll cobble together a basic HowTo.

FYI only -- building the 2.4 kernel with no modules (all internal) did
the trick, my ext3 partition mounts, emlog loads, ppp/eth0 still work
and everything.

I had to build a whole bunch of stuff in a neato way for a 2.4 kernel
that was uber easy to integrate -- if anyone is interested, gimme a
holler and I'll cobble together a basic HowTo.

Well, I looked here:

   ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sct/ext3/

and saw how low the version number was on it, and the date, so I didn't 
even bother.  It's more important for me to have a known good 
implementation of a stable kernel - I need that data on that partition 
to be as reliable as possible...

Subject: [Peeweelinux] selecting a compact flash reader
Message-ID: <OF98CD5B1D.8528F45A-ON4A256BD0.0008E17B@juptech.com>

Hi All,

I am currently working on a project which uses an IDE-->Compact Flash
converter on the main board to treat the compact flash as /dev/hdc.
Techs in the field will need to update both to and from this device using a
USB compact flash reader, which can be attached as required.

I have been using a Sandisk ImageMate SDDR-05 reader during development
which is occasionally flaky. (Could be the way I have it running that is
flaky :)


Having made a short story longer than it needs to be, has anyone any
experience using USB compact flash readers ?
Can anyone recommend a robust one to run under a 2.4 kernel ?

All suggestions appreciated,

Kind regards,

Delaney.

We bought the "IOGear MemoryBank USB 2.0 Flash Card Reader" (model 
gfr201) and it's working 100% on my 2.4.18 kernel. Nary a lick of a 
problem operationally. (I already own an Archos jukebox and Sony DSC 
digcam, so I had generic scsi/etc built into the kernel)

It's easy, though, to slip the CF card in backwards -- I did, and it 
jammed.  An hour and a bunch of screwdrivers later, I had repaired the 
situation.  Be careful, the CF card sits in the device with it's back 
towards you, opposite what you'd think it should be.

Hmmmmmmmmmmm...I'm using the Imagemate on my development system with no
problems. Have you got the scsi-ide parameter set and the right driver
loaded?

Using the Sandisk SDDR-31. Works like a charm with 2.4.x kernel as well as
2.2.17 with the USB backport.

Hi Tom,

which driver do you refer to ?
I am just loading usc-core, and sd_mod (generic scsi support ?) and acces
the imagemate as /dev/sda

Hmmmmmmmmmmm...I'm using the Imagemate on my development system with no

loaded?

Here is the driver stack I have loaded:

usb-core
usb-uhci (this drives the USB chip - you may need OHCI)
scsi-mod
ide-scsi

Note, this is under Redhat 7.3...but the same stack was being used 
under Mandrake 8.0 and below.

Hi Tom,
I am using Mandrake 8.1

>scsi-mod
>ide-scsi

I wasn't loading the ide-scsi module, I'll add this.


Thanks for the tip,

(and thanks to everyone for their responses on the different CF readers)

What I meant to ask was if it comes included on 2.2.x sources... I haven't
compiled a kernel in a couple of years :))

Well, I looked here:

   ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sct/ext3/

and saw how low the version number was on it, and the date, so I didn't
even bother.  It's more important for me to have a known good
implementation of a stable kernel - I need that data on that partition
to be as reliable as possible...

I think you are missing usb-storage. I have one and it works great, I just
"mount /dev/sda1 /mnt" and it finds all dependencies on RH7.2

Nope, afraid not -- I'm not exactly sure, but I *think* it went into the 
official kernel sources at 2.4.18; the last patch released was 
2.4.18pre3 (http://www.zipworld.com.au/~akpm/linux/ext3/), which tends 
to support my guess....

Subject: [Peeweelinux] kernel 2.4 mini-howto
Message-ID: <3CFF9B98.2030902@fluid.com>

Below follows my basic method for integrating a 2.4 kernel into the 
peeweelinux distro; some steps may be missing, so may not be needed, 
some may not be efficient.  Hey, I was winging it. ;)  Adjust as 
appropriate/necessary.

My build scenario is /usr/local/pwl/Embedded_Build/ - referred to as 
$PWL from now on.

Step 1 - Build yourself the new Kernel (2.4.18)
===============================================
1) Build a custom kernel of the existing 2.2.17 sources.  This ensures 
that you can properly build and deploy a custom kernel on your dev box 
(eg, on RedHat 7.2 you have all the compat-* RPMS installed and know how 
to use them).

2) create a subdir in the PWL build scenario to hold all your nifty 
files -- for me, it's:  $PWL/custom_kernel (referred to as $CUSTOM from 
here on)

3) create $CUSTOM/usr/src, and untar the kernel sources into there. 
Rename "linux" to "linux-2.4.18" (eg), and symlink linux to it.  Just 
like you would in a real kernel build.

4) cd to $CUSTOM/usr/src/linux, run "make mrproper"

5) copy $PWL/kernelbuild/usr/src/linux/.config (notice the dot) to 
$CUSTOM/usr/src/linux/

6) run "make oldconfig", then run "make menuconfig".  choose kernel 
options as appropriate.

7) edit "Makefile" and change "gcc" to "kgcc" (I'm on RH72, using the 
RH62 compat packages)

8) run "make dep", "make bzImage", and "make modules" as normal. 
(remember to source the compat-* script if you need to first!)

9) mkdir -p $CUSTOM/kernel-root/boot and mkdir -p 
$CUSTOM/kernel-root/lib/modules

10) cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage $CUSTOM/kernel-root/boot

11) "make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=$CUSTOM/kernel-root modules_install"


Step 2 - Build the kernel package
=================================
1) cd $CUSTOM/kernel-root

2) cp -a $PWL/kernelbuild/kernel-buildroot/dev .  (I don't know what 
these devices are used for, but figured it couldn't hurt to drag 'em 
along for the ride)


NOTE: at this point, add your custom devices -- eg, the watchdog device. 
  For example, "cd $CUSTOM/kernel-root/dev, mknod watchdog c 10 130"


3) find dev > kernel-2.4.18.list, find boot >> kernel-2.4.18.list, find 
lib >> kernel-2.4.18.list

4) edit kernel-2.4.18.list and add trailing slashes to *all* directory 
names!  Very important that you do this.

5) tar -cf kernel-2.4.18.tar boot/ dev/ lib/

6) cp kernel-2.4.18.* $PWL/packages/Kernel_Custom/


Now, at this point all you need to do is run pwlconfig, go into the 
kernel-custom stuff, and use your new kernel instead of the old one. 
Pretty simple.  However, as suggested in the Changes file, you want to 
update some other files as well (eg, "su" from busybox doesn't work as 
well as insmod).  So, I also built custom packages of the following:

   e2fsprogs-1.27
   emlog-0.40
   modutils-2.4.16
   ppp-2.4.1
   util-linux-2.11r

The exact same scenario as above is used to build these custom packages; 
let's use emlog as an example, as many folks will want that with their 
new kernel.

Step 3 - Build supporting packages (emlog used as example)
==========================================================
1) cd $CUSTOM/usr/src

2) untar emlog-0.40 package

3) cd emlog-0.40, edit "Makefile" to set the path to kernel sources 
(eg,/usr/local/pwl/Embedded_Build/custom_kernel/linux).  Also edit "gcc" 
to use "kgcc" like you did for the kernel above -- not sure if it's 
necessary, but I figured it couldn't hurt.

4) run 'make'

5) mkdir -p $CUSTOM/emlog-root/lib/modules/2.4.18/kernel/drivers/misc/, 
mkdir -p $CUSTOM/emlog-root/usr/bin, mkdir -p $CUSTOM/emlog-root/var/log

6) cp emlog.o 
$CUSTOM/emlog-root/lib/modules/2.4.18/kernel/drivers/misc/, cp nbcat 
$CUSTOM/emlog-root/usr/bin

7) cd $CUSTOM/emlog-root/var/log, mknod messages c 241 8

8) find lib > emlog-0.40-2.4.18.list, find usr >> 
emlog-0.40-2.4.18.list, find var >> emlog-0.40-2.4.18.list

9) edit emlog-0.40-2.4.18.list and add trailing slashes to paths

10) tar -cf emlog-0.40-2.4.18.tar lib/ usr/ var/

11) cp emlog-0.40-2.4.18.* $PWL/packages/Kernel_Custom/


Now you can do like you did for the kernel, and just go select the new 
emlog package (don't forget to deselect the old kernel-2.2.17 one!) to 
get the module installed.  You still need to deploy your own 
'rc.modules' script to actually "insmod emlog" on boot.

NOTE: you *must* build the modutils and use that insmod to load emlog.o 
-- I found that trying to use the 'old' one symlinked to busybox didn't 
work due to unresolved dependancies.

The only other real custom thing with the supporting packages was the 
ppp device; you need to make sure you "mknod ppp c 108 0" in a dev/ tree 
and add that to your ppp-2.4.1.list packaging.  This is buried in some 
doc somewhere that I found.

Errors, omissions, etc - please feel free to correct and enhance.  I've 
replaced and rebuilt and customized so much, I'm not sure what I could 
have missed here.... (eg, lots of crap to suppport Unix98 ptys so telnet 
logins work)

Subject: [Peeweelinux] DiskOnChip Boot Problems
Message-ID: <F252k38dWMJ69ik6kvX0001b160@hotmail.com>

For anyone that may be interested, I answered my own question.  The problem 
is the sfdisk command in the PeeWee script pwl_target_load.  The sfdisk 
command attempts to create a partition on the DiskOnChip (DOC) but it 
corrupts the partition table (I think) and renders it unbootable instead.

Be advised that the PeeWee documentation that suggests that all you have to 
do is get the DOC to mount on your development system and PeeWee will do the 
rest is incorrect.  Several script mods are required.

Hi all,

Here is a very easy question : I don't know much about Linux :-(.

I would like to run a short script at the boot of PeeWee (example : loadkmap <
azerty.map, run my soft, etc ...)

I think that juste like in every Linux, I have to add some lines in a special
file. But what is this file ?

Thank you.

Hi Guillaume,

I have added my stuff to the end of the /etc/rc.sysinit script. In my case I load modules for RTLinux RTOS, but you could launch any programs or scripts. These are launched as root, so just be aware of any security issues. To modify the rc.sysinit you need to go to the project folder under peewee and then into a folder called "custom" Then do this:

mkdir etc
cp ../mnt/etc/rc.sysinit  ./etc


then you can edit your custom/etc/rc.sysinit file and it will be copied to your target.

hope this helps,

~Ken

Message-ID: <3D00D3C4.C3268D36@h2eye.com>


Hi,

I would like to know whether anybody has got ethernet working over USB with 
PWL. I have been using PWL for a while now in a standalone unit running 
from compact flash. I was using 2.2.19. Now I need to get USB support, and
usbnet working on it, and I'd like to know whether PWL will support that,
and what to include in the project. 
While I am carrying out my own tests, if somebody out there has done it, 
it would be great to get some help. Ultimately, I need to set up an ftp
and/or http server over the USB connection. Hence, if somebody has some
pointers on how to do that, it would be great also.
I am still running 0.53, but I guess I will be downloading 0.61 soon.

Thanks in advance,

Jaime

HEllo Jaime,

I have never done ethernet over USB, but I would imagine that an adapter that is supported by the 2.4 kernel would work for you. You can build your own custom kernel with Peewee and copy it to the custom/boot folder of your project. it has to be named /boot/bzImage to work witht he default pwl build.

Guillaume,

If you've built your PWL with "SysV support" (most likely you have), 
then the easiest (and more correct) thing to do is create a script that 
lives in /etc/rcS.d/ directory (eg, "90mystuff").

On boot, the subsystem walks through this directory and executes all 
scripts in order numerically, lowest to highest.  The problem with 
rc.sysinit is that it's executed before any /etc/rcS.d/ scripts, which 
may adversely affect your application.

It's then easy to do a Custom File Add on your initscript and keep it 
seperate from the core PWL stuff.  I note, though, that loading modules 
should take place in /etc/rc.modules, which is sourced by rc.sysinit if 
it exists.

Hi!

Well, 'correct' is always a subjective thing. ;)  My way is only valid 
for a SysV style setup (which RedHat is); if you've built a BSD style 
setup then files like /etc/rc.sysinit, /etc/rc.local, and so on are the 
more correct way.

Yeesh, as always 800million ways to do the same thing...

I had the same problem. Seems to be down to the kernel image
being called bzImage-Full instead of what the script expects, 
i.e., bzImage.
You can extract your file system, and then manually change
the name (in_your_project_dir/mnt/boot). Then copy it 
onto your target and it should work. It did for me.

hi,

I am running pwl-0.61.1. I've generated a project with everything except X stuff. 
However, there is no ftpd (although the entry is there in inetd.conf). An entry 
in the mailing list from Dec'01 claims that there should be an ftpd bundled with 
PWL, but I can't find it. inetd.conf points to /usr/sbin/ftpd, and that is 
definitely not there. I can't find it in the obvious places in the pwl web page. 
Any pointers?

(I've also tried some of the RPM's in http://adis.on.ca/pub/Projects/MyRPMS/, but 
my rpm - RH6.1 - always complains that these packages have a major version > 3 
I can't read them, so I don't know whether it's true or my RPM is playing up. ???


Thanks


Jaime

Hi Adi,

I have checked my 0.61 binary download of peewee, and the netkit-ftp rpm
contained within only has an ftp client (/usr/bin/ftp), the daemon doesn't
seem to be present.

I am using my own (severely mangled to allow it to work :) 'version' of
wu-ftpd at the moment - but I would prefer to use the peewee daemon if it
is available.
(that way I don't have to kludge up pam stuff)

Kind regards,
Delaney.

Hi Adi,

I am sorry, but I can't see it there. It was the first obvious place to look for 
it, but that is only the client /usr/bin/ftp. I have re-extracted the binary RPM 
that came with 0.61.1 to the PWL binary package again, and it is the same. I have
also downloaded the netkit-ftp-0.10-1.i386.rpm from your web page, and it is the 
same: only the client. (as well as the ncftp)

Guillaume,

If you've built your PWL with "SysV support" (most likely you have),
then the easiest (and more correct) thing to do is create a script that
lives in /etc/rcS.d/ directory (eg, "90mystuff").

On boot, the subsystem walks through this directory and executes all
scripts in order numerically, lowest to highest.  The problem with
rc.sysinit is that it's executed before any /etc/rcS.d/ scripts, which
may adversely affect your application.

It's then easy to do a Custom File Add on your initscript and keep it
seperate from the core PWL stuff.  I note, though, that loading modules
should take place in /etc/rc.modules, which is sourced by rc.sysinit if
it exists.

Hi,

	Yesterday I downloaded the mailing list archive and read through it. I
understood that peewee doesn't use CVS, and instead the latest version is
available from a server.

	Is the version currently available the latest release, or has work been
done on it that hasn't been released ? should I upgrade with rsync ?

thanks

Hi,

size of one of the partitions it creates is being miscalculated (I think),
because one it tries to copy the files there, it runs out of disk space.

	I'm also going to need an extra (4th ?) parition, that will be read-write.
any ideas on how to configure this ?

Hello,

I have had a problem with read only with multiple RAM disks also. I had to modify one of the scripts and have it reserve an extra chunk of disk for my installation. I couldn't figure out why it was miscalculating the size that the disk needs.

It should be started using "inetd" -- there should be a line in 
/etc/inetd.conf like this:

telnet	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/telnetd	telnetd

If I remember correctly, selecting Network->netkit-telnet and all the 
packages under Network_Base should handle this automatically.

Message-ID: <3D10B19D.7010609@fluid.com>

On my end, I wasn't able to get telnetd to allow logins until I:

a) built a kernel with Unix98 PTY support
b) create the device /dev/ptmx (mknod ptmx c 5 2)
c) make the directory /dev/pts
d) add "none /dev/pts devpts gid=5,mode=622 0 0" to /etc/fstab

A was done as part of the kernel 2.4 (see my howto), B and C I edited 
the various PWL packages and retar'd, for D I added a line to my custom 
rc.modules like so:

   # this is for telnetd to allocate ptys to allow login
   echo "none /dev/pts devpts gid=5,mode=622 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

So, your mileage may vary.  Hey, for those interested -- the rapid 
protoype we built/fabbed and flew out the the client's site last week 
(using PWL) was awesome; the client wants to sign a contract for us to 
keep on rockin' and build the production models, etc. for them.

Thanks PWL team!

telnetd worked fine for me, without any configuration , you just need to
include the right packages (telnet-kit, I think)

Message-ID: <1179FFD5B43CD4118D220050042A54142C5821@www.krypton.be>

Dear all, 

I have been using Peewee Linux for some time now with an M-systems Disk On
Module, with great satisfaction. Thanks to anyone who contributed to
PeeweeLinux!

Now, I would like to install PeeWeeLinux on an M-systems Disk-On-Chip. I am
using redhat 7.2 with kernel version 2.4.2 as a development platform. The
PeeWeeLinux kernel version I am using is 2.2.17. I have pwlconfig 0.61.

Can anyone point me to an up-to-date instruction set on how to do this?

I found some information in the mailing list archives which is a bit
confusing and might be out of date.

Thanks,

Jan De Geeter

Hi Jan,

My understanding of the DiskOnChip/Linux situation is that there are two ways 
to accomplish this:

1.  Use M-Systems "TrueFFS v5.0 for Linux (x86)", from www.m-sys.com.
2.  Use the Memory Technology Device (MTD) Subsystem for Linux:

	http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/
	http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc2000.html

It's been my experience that using the MTD option is much easier.  Also, the 
M-Systems option is a binary-only driver, and can only be used as a loadable 
module.  From their installation instructions:

	This installation manual will guide through the process installing the
	DiskOnChip TrueFFS driver for Linux as a loadubale module (GPL complient).

	Note: Installing this driver as part of the Linux kernel is NOT GPL complient
	and should only be used for testing or R&D purposes.

In other words, you don't get the source code when using TrueFFS.  The MTD 
source is part of the Linux kernel itself; you don't need to use "initrd" in 
order to boot from the DoC.  

Anyway, I typed up some instructions on using Peewee to configure a bootable 
DoC, using MTD and a 2.4 kernel.  I'm not sure how things would work with a 
2.2.17 kernel, but I believe there may be MTD patches available for 2.2. 
kernels if needed.  For now, these instructions are at:

	http://www.lakeshoremicro.com/peeweedoc.txt

Additionally, if you decide to use a 2.4 kernel,  Troy Engel's kernel 2.4 
mini-howto might help:

	http://mail.adis.on.ca/pipermail/peeweelinux/2002-June/000608.html

If your feeling adventurous, I also wrote up some instructions on using GRUB 
(rather than LILO) to boot a DiskOnChip:

	http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2002-June/005240.html

I hope this helps.

Hi all,

I am trying to get a perl script program (that uses Tk and a widget) working 
using peewee.  The problem that I am having is this:


a:  there is no perl libraries on peewee, so can i just use the content of 
/usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1/i386-linux and hope that works? is there a small perl 
distribution?

b: will i have to do the same for Tk and the widget?

c: i want to update the libs that peewee uses (i dont want to use the 2.1.3's 
that come with peewee, i want to use 2.2.4's that come with redhat 7.2) and 
addes to /lib and /lib/i686, where can i do this?

any help appreciated.

thanks
Justin

I would also like to upgrade my glibc and also add GTK libs to my custom peewee. If I do this, will I have to rebuild all the packages in peewee by hand, or is glibc backwards compatable??

Rebuild a system from sources if you upgrade glibc, just
about EVERYTHING uses it - and the build choices software
makes changes depending on versions etc.  Most likely,
they will only run with the exact version they were
compiled against.  If the kernel is the "engine" of a Linux
system, then glibc is the nuts and bolts that hold the
chasis together!

Adding libs is less drastic, compile & install.

If you are doing a lot of stuff, why not try:

   www.linuxfromscratch.org

which is exactly what it says on the tin - namely building
a Linux system from sources.  You can go as new as you like,
and because they explain what (just about) everything is for,
you can decide whether you need it in the final installation.
[much of it is compiler related stuff].  Of course, substitue
Busybox for most of the tools they use.
