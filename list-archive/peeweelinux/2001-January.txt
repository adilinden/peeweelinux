Hi,

Just a thought, would it be helpful to have a target option in pwlconfig
that simply copies the new system onto a partition on an existing drive
with dualboot support, etc?

Adi,
Yep..I've done this several times manually, however rebooting the
development box is a bit of a pain...I always partition my drives
with a couple 40Mb partitions at the end for just such occasions...

Don't forget to manually change the default to reflect the new root
dev/partition...maybe need another default for "test partition" ?

Also, the dual boot option (from v0.48?) copied the /etc/lilo.conf 
file from the development system before it genereated the new 
lilo.conf.XXX file...that seemed to work for me but may present 
problems for someone with lots of lilo.conf files around...

I think for testing purposes booting off a floppy should be fine rather then dealing with
lilo.

Subject: pwlconfig custom file problem
Message-ID: <3A563ECF.A10C2830@amiga.com>

Adi,

I've come across a bit of a problem with the handling of custom files in
pwl. If any directories have spaces in their names, the initial check
when pwlconfig loads erroneously indicates that the source and custom
directories aren't in sync. What appears to be happening is that any
files in a custom directory that has an embedded space are assumed to
belong in the root of the custom source directory.

IF you need an example, I can send you one. As a simple test however,
create a project that uses a custom directory structure as follows:

"<custom_src>/test dir/foo"
"<custom_src>/test dir/bar"
"<custom_src>/test dir/foobar"


If you add this to a project at root, exit pwlconfig, then re-enter
pwlconfig you will get a list of file in your custom directory that do
not exist in you custom source directory. The list will look something
like this:

"<custom_src>/dir/foo"
"<custom_src>/dir/bar"
"<custom_src>/dir/foobar"

It seems that when you are creating your .list files, you aren't quoting
paths with spaces embedded in them.

This is a problem for me since the application I am trying to run on my
system has embedded spaces in the paths that I don't have control over.

Subject: FlashDisk vs RamDisk+FlashDisk partitions
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.10101051502080.27881-100000@mail.ituner.com>

Happy New Year everybody! 

While reading your postings I noticed  some
messges related to fsck/journaling filesystem
implementations for PeeWeeLinux. 

How about having the folowing ramdisk/flashdisk arrangement
thus avoiding running fsck based on the assumption that
fsck gets invoked due to a *modified* filesystem, not corruption,
(CF doesn't get corrupted on power off)

1) I think it is quite possible to have your / partition
,read only, mounted on the FlashDisk and something like
/var mounted on a ramdisk. So your endless logging and 
'scratchpad area' will be volatile, therefore each time the 
machine crashes or is powered off, /var will be lost, but no 
changes will be recorded on "/" filesystem, therefore fsck 
will not be invoked.

2) Compress the entire filesystem into the FlashDisk and
then load it into RamDisk. This consumes more RAM, but it 
seems to be the fastest, however costly due to the fact 
that the compression radio is 1:3 and CF/RAM price ratio 
is only 1:2...  

Am I missing something? I prefer #1, Which one would you choose?

Best Regards and thank you in advance,
Andrei

Hi Andrei,

PeeWeeLinux supports different ways of loading a target device. This
includes having a single large partition on the flash drive (ext2 or FAT)
that contains the kernel and ramdisk image (compressed filesystem). In
this arrangement there is no easy way to save anything, though.

Another alternative (already in PeeWeeLinux) is to have an uncompressed
filesystem on flash which is loaded into memory and run from a ramdisk.
This allows for the flash to be mounted (read-write) and changes to be
made that will take effect once the system is rebooted.

Lastly there is a mixed approach. Quite close to your #1 suggestion. Have
a read-only root partition on flash. Load /etc, /dev/ and /var into 
ramdisks. The reason for /etc is that the system needs write access to
some files in /etc, the reason for /dev is that in order to write to
devices the partition the node is created on needs to be writable. And
/var you've explained already. Depending on how the /etc branch is created
it could be saved to flash by mounting the appropriate partition
read/write.

Future kernel releases will include devfs and reiserfs or ext3. devfs
allows for a virtual device filesystem, similar to how /proc works. This
would eliminate the need for a /dev ramdisk and preserve a moderate amount
of memory and flash since each device currently consumes one inode on the
filesystem it resides on.

You can corrupt flash if you remove power during a write operation.
Apparently ext3 and reiserfs would automatically recover and fall back to
a last known good state. Now that's my understanding based on rumours
rather than research on my part.

The read-only root filesystem with ramdisks for /etc, /var and /dev
that's implementedin PeeWeeLinux works but it could use some more fine
tuning, I think.

TTYL,
Adi

Thank you for the info. I like the mixed aproach because it tends to
save RAM. In my case, my flash build is quite large 64Mb (not because
of peewee), therefore I need to allocate another 64RAM for ramdisk
plus some for the OS...

The trick is mount/unmounting the /etc flash partition in order   
to save changes, if any. I suspect that changes on /etc
are not as dynamic (system settings), hence mounting/unmounting 
can be done on demand.

Excellent! Will this be on 2.4 or 2.2.x? Just curious... (very)

With a filesystem of that size using the read-only root approach is
defenitely the way to go.

I prefer to mount everything, except mount flash partitions as read-only
and change them to read-write for the short period when writing is really
necessary.

The current kernel is 2.2.17 with usb support among other things. I hope
to go to 2.2.18 with devfs and reiserfs soon (no promises on dates) and
perhaps add 2.4.x as experimental kernel sometime after that.

I have downloaded the PWL software (0.53.25) and it looks good.  I have one
question.  Can you custom configure the kernel?  I see a pwl_kernel file in the
scripts directory, but can't seem to find it on the menu.  Keep up the good

Hi,

Soon! pwl_kernel is being worked on at the moment. I 
just haven't created a new release since the 
preliminary work has been done. The next release will 
be 0.60.0 to indicate a stable release. The kernel 
build function will be included as an experimental 
feature. I also hope to address a problem with spaces 
in custom file paths.

TTYL,
Adi

Message-ID: <200101111355.OAA13659@gauvain.enssat.fr>

Hi !,
I need to install a bootable PeeWee Linux System on a 16Mo Disk On Chip...
So, I use pwlconfig to generate the file system and configure the boot 
device....
I've selected a basci file system for my target (with the Project File 
System menu), extract it and 
Configure the TArget Hardware....
I don't know which option to choose for Target 
 So I've kept : Compressed ramdisk on ext2 partition
I just want to generate a bootable system with all the basic linux 
directories and minimal tools...
After that I select : LoadFile System Onto Target /dev/msys/fla
All seem be OK but the results shown an error :
Installing Lilo............. failed :-(

I'm using the 0.53.25 version from a 2.2.5-15 kernel with a built in disk on 
chip driver...

Help please....
Thanks

Hey,
We got this error message just yesterday also. The scripts 
toss the actual error messages from LILO so its hard to tell
whats wrong.

The lilo.conf file is created in the Embedded_build/tmp directory
so, you can type the following from the command line:

Embedded_Build # lilo -C tmp/lilo.conf

This will show the error message generated by lilo.  In our case,
we assigned a VGA parameter incorrectly, lilo said error on line
16 which was fixed by changing the defaults we had entered.
Fixed that and our Compact Flash card booted first time!

I think some better error handling is in order here...now where's
that to do list ?:)

Hi,

Disk-On-Chip requires a special patched version of LILO. When using
M-Systems Disk-On-Chip I recommend using a FAT based boot partition with
syslinux as bootloader. It doesn't have any of the problems lilo has.

Hi Ralph,

The pwl_target scripts creates a log file in Embedded_Build/tmp/rd.log  I
plan on an option to view this file from within pwlconfig if the target
load failed... Yup, another one to add to the todo list.

Some important items on the todo list:

- proper handling of custom files with embedded spaces
- add xterm-color to termcap
- pwl_kernel development
- new 2.2.17 kernel w/pwl_kernel_functions and icmp masq
- single partition target for dualboot applications
  - with instructions for manual lilo.conf manipulation

Some enhancements:

- 2.2.18 kernel
- 2.4.x kernel
  - devfs
  - reiserfs and/or ext3
- example/starter configuration with busybox/tinylogin

And still... Documentation...!!! I want to get a FAQ started since there
are a lot of questions and answers in the list archives.

Anything I missed?

TTYL,
Adi

Adi,
Looks like a good list...just keeps going and going and ...

How about:
   - manual/scripts for building your own packages
     (we need to constantly upgrade our files - you
     shouldn't be the only one having fun making packages!:)
-----------

rd.log - I'll take a look at this, I think I can popup a window 
that displays the log file...didn't notice that you 
had already created a log file, cool...

-----------
To do the dual boot, I think you can globally replace the
hardcoded partition number grep "}1" in pwl_target*
with a variable rd_part or whatever (just add one for the
multi-partition stuff ?) 

Now add another default variable for the base partition 
number (default to 1 and you will have the same code
you have now)...change to 6 and you can load/mount to /dev/xxx6.

Now, you have to build the lilo thing for dual boot. Is there
any way you can seperate lilo into seperate functions ? (I still
like the menu option to lilo, but that may just be me:)
-----
I never got back to the kernel thing (our priorities shift with
the weather :-o)...glad to hear it worked  for you, maybe I'll 
try that with the next release.

Later,
Ralph

I guess I should chime in here. :-)

About two weeks ago I had a somewhat similiar problem.

There are directions for creating an EXT2FS on the DOC that are
available from M-Systems.  It really is quite easy.   I think it
is a PDF file which I can dig up.

I am using the M-Systems patched lilo for my setup.  I boot off
the DOC and am able to then pick a configuration that has the root
on the DOC or the IDE disk I have.

I am able to do a lilo operation on the DOC even when I am booted
off the disk.   It is just a matter of specifying the proper root
for lilo.

The hardware is a GCT-Allwell system.

I did not use all of the PeeWeeLinux facilities to do this.  I do
have a working system on a 8 MB DOC.  Now all I have to do is 
get the system set up as a router.

Is there a way to get greater compression on any parts of the
distribution?  It would be nice to get a smaller kernel or libraries.

I built and installed my own kernel and took out everything I could
think of.  I could use some more room.

The only other thing I can think of is to put some of the libraries
into a RAM disk that is loaded at boot time.

In-Reply-To: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10101110951230.16084-100000@develop.knet.on.ca>
Message-ID: <BIEGJHBDMMJJLMDJGDEPIEOLCBAA.richr@world.std.com>

I have a ruggedized 386sx with built-in 85MB Harddisk, ethernet - but no
CDROM or standard IDE bus. I have gotten peewee linux to work by doing a
manual install of the filesystem from a network-live boot disk and used
lilo to get the machine to boot from it's internal hard disk.

One of the means I was trying to use before I went manual was to use a
loopback mounted file with a filesystem created in it. i.e.:

dd if=/dev/zero of=PARTITION bs=1024 count=3096  # Create a 32 Meg partition
mke2fs PARTITION						 # Create a ext2 partition on the file
mkdir pmnt
mount -o loop PARTITION					 # Mount it to ensure all is ok
umount pmnt

At this point I am not allowed to access this file as /directory/PARTITION
as if
I would access /dev/hda because the scripts make sure that the file is a
special
device (which it isn't).

Is this path at all feasible? My ultimate intention is to be able to prepare
the
filesystem with pwlconfig and "burn" it to the file PARTITION and then boot
from a
floppy on my destination machine and use something like tftp and dd to load
it onto a
32MB partition on the remote computers harddisk...

Comments?

Actually, making packages is easy if you get into using rpm. That's really
all ther is to it. I don't think there's much that could be done with
pwlconfig.

There is nothing send to /dev/null in the pwl_target* scripts. Whatever
isn't send to the success/unsuccess screen is captured by rd.log.

It's not that easy because the pwl_target_load functions include embedded
commands to fdisk your device. You don't want that on a dualboot :-O

So it'll be another target option with some specific parameters (Target
Partition) and it's own pwl_target_load function.

Lilo menu?

I am pretty busy building the network. Lots happening all at once so there
isn't much time left doing PeeWeeLinux development. It's also accounting
time :-O  I am caught up with most, though.

One thing the kernel build still needs is a means to integrate a build
kernel into a project. Perhaps buy creating a custom package or a package
that gets added to the Embedded_Build/package/Custom_Kernel (new)
directory???

If the build kernel is added to the custom files structure it might mean
plenty of manual labour to remove files if a new kernel is compiled.
Creating a kernel tar file to be placed into the packages structure might
be the answer.

Another thought that came up was the ability to move all the build
directories outside of the Embedded_Build directory. So one can update to
a new PeeWeeLinux release without loosing all the pre-existing content. It
would also allow for PeeWeeLinux to run from CD without copying the whole
structure to HD. This means changing most or all paths in pwl_functions to
absolute paths...

Adi

Anyone interested in viewing a more detailed listing of the log
files, try inserting the following two lines of script

----------------------
pwl_target_functions:

 copy messages to the log files to keep track of whats 
 being done (at about line 462)
----------------------
func_rd_action()
     ...
     m*)
        ...
        echo $2 >> $rd_log        # << add this line
        ;;
 
----------
pwl_config:
  append the log file to the result list file (at about line 400)
----------
func device_load_fs()
{
  ...
  # Show Results if selected
  ...
  else
    cat $rd_log >> .load.log     # << add this line
    show_results ...
----------

This shows the list of action messages and their results followed by
each message and the data collected when that action item was
executed.  This should help in debugging any target loading problems.

Enjoy
Ralph

Adi - you might add this to the mainline code unless you can come up 
with something better...

Hi Ralph,

This is a really neat idea. I modified it slightly. I no longer supress
the output of pwl_target_load, so now the progress of each step is visible
as it is being done. Beats sitting in darkness and wondering what the box
is up to when things get loaded :)

At the log prompt the log being shown if yes is selected is the
tmp/rd_log. With your idea for inserting the comments it's quite useful.
Thanks for the hint!

I just finished 0.53.27 and it needs some testing... It's available from
http://peeweelinux.org/pub/Projects/Embedded/peeweelinux-0.53.27-cfg.tar.gz

Hi Dean,

I finally had time to do some more work on pwlconfig. I figured bugfixes
are a priority. So the current release includes a fix for the problem you
reported. It was caused by the method used to parse the custom.list file
and insufficient quoting.

So here is the latest pwlconfig archive (799kB):
http://peeweelinux.org/pub/Projects/Embedded/peeweelinux-0.53.27-cfg.tar.gz

Since these changes only affect the pwlconfig scripts I didn't build the
other archives that usually go with releases.

Please give this a good workout and report any problems! I will be pretty
busy these next few days and won't have much of a chance to actually use
PeeWeeLinux myself.

TTYL,
Adi

Hi,

If I understand correctly the different firmware versions simply use
different addresses on the Disk-On-Chip device. So the patched lilo lives
in a different address space than the original lilo. Making things
compatible.

I have not used Disk-On-Chip as an attached drive at all. My way of
loading a Disk-On-Chip system is somewhat of a workarround. I build my
filesystem and load it onto a CompactFlash card. My board with the
Disk-On-CHip also has an IDE port. With the CompactFlash plugged into the
IDE port I can now run fdisk, syslinx manually and copy the files to the
Disk-On-Chip device.

I am looking at different ways of getting a PeeWeeLinux system onto target
devices. It could be possible to run an tftp server and use netboot to
load a target. Or have a floppy (if a drive is availabel on the target) to
boot and make the target available to PeeWeeLinux. But I haven't been able
to wrap my head around this just yet. No real idea how to integrate
something like that into PeeWeeLinux.

TTYL,
Adi

Subject: ro root with multiple ramdisks
Message-ID: <001301c07f6e$833b3700$1e00a8c0@midsouth.rr.com>

Hello,
I was having a little trouble with the "read-only root fs with multiple
ramdisks" I was getting an out of space condition on the / filesystem when
pwl_target_load did its copy of initrd. I found two potential problems with
the root fs space calculation:

1) /home free space as specified is being subtracted from the root fs size
calulation
2) The size of initrd was not added to the root fs size calculation

When I corrected the above, things seemed to work a bit better, thought I
would let you know.

Thanks,
Don Fike

Subject: New Feature? Configuration for ramdisks/hdd...
Message-ID: <20010119162900.88805.qmail@web9108.mail.yahoo.com>

Adi,
We are in the process of switching to the new-improved-latest version
of PeeWee linux.  One problem occured which I may have a solution for
(or you may have a better solution) is trying to build our own unique
filesystem - one that doesn't match the one built by pwl_target*
scripts...

If you recall, our system contains the following partitions:
1. boot/root partition (ro)
2. user partition (rw)
3. Ramdisk for /etc
4. Ramdisk for /dev

So, using the new target hardware we select the "read only root"
with multiple ramdisks..

However, the pwl_target* scripts force us to use the /home directory
as a ramdisk, mirrored from another partition.  While this may be a
good choice, it seems that the configuration tool should not dictate
the file system (since everything else is configurable).

Anyhow, I have have been hacking on pwl_target* scripts (without GUI
support yet) for the following:
...in some init function for now (will be default parameters)...
   hd_mnt_0=/
   hd_mnt_1=
   ...
   hd_mnt_7=
   rd_mnt_0=
   rd_mnt_1=/dev
   rd_mnt_2=/etc
   rd_mnt_3=/tmp
   ...
   rd_mnt_7=

So, with these variables, I can specify which directories are
compressed into ramdisk image files and load them at boot time.
Also, these variables allowed me to remove all of pre-defined
directories (/etc, /dev, ...) from the pwl_target* scripts.  Only the
initrd directories are built as required to make it boot.

Also, by specifying the partitions, we should be able to boot this
from a small partition on the development drive...have to work out
the lilo thing, but this looks like it would work...

Now, using these variables, the scripts build the following:
  ramdisk.1  (compressed image of the $rd_mnt_1 variable)
  ramdisk.2  (  ""                            2  ""     )
  ramdisk.3  (  ""                            3  ""     )
  linuxrc    (loads ramdisks ramdisk.1 ramdisk.2 ramdisk.3)
  initrd     (as configured by linuxrc)
  fstab      (filesystem table matches ramdisks as configured)
  rc.init    (builds mtab to match the configuration)
  lilo.conf (no change)

So far so good. The files seem to look like the previous files but
match the configuration for the ramdisks.  I copied nearly all of
your code or the at least the spirit of your code - of course,
instead of the single 300+ line function, I have lots of little
functions (sorry, old habits die hard :)

Still to do:
1. make this system boot
-- have to build the ld.so.cache thing too
2. verify the size thing
3. add support for configured hard drive partitions
4. add the parameter setups
5. rework the other target devices that require ramdisks

And some questions:
Is there some reason that /var is linked under /dev ?

Does the initrd use the same fstab (why is fstab built twice in the
build_ro_root function ?)

Is the /home directory mirrored from a partition a common/desirable
thing to do ? 
-- I'd need to define someway to specify that ramdisk=/home is not
compressed by pwlconfig but copied at boot time from some other
configured partition

Your thoughts ? Is this interesting or just something we need ?
I'll try to get a system to boot today and send you a copy - or
anyone else who is very brave, let me know...(of course, I'm out to
BIOS world next week, so we can just let the code fester for a while
:)

Later,
Ralph

I've modified the scripts to remove the /home partition and just leave
it in with the root fs. In my case I want the /home directory structure
to be read only in order to eliminate any possibility of the application
getting trashed. For permanent writable store, I create custom symbolic
links that point to the last partition that I mount as read write. What
you have described looks like it goes a long ways towards being able to
implement what I need in a generic fashion.

You're right, the filesystems which reside entirely in a ramdisk are
pretty straight forward and there aren't really any more choices than
what's been presented.

I still like to add the load onto existing partition type. This should
make for an easy to use dual-boot without the need for a dedicted drive.

Anyhow, the read-only root system doesn't offer much flexibility as it is
now... hmmm... make that no flexebility? One of the features I hope to add
in the near future is a kernel with devfs. This would eliminate the /dev
ramdisk all together. So making the read-only ramdisk target more flexible
is certainly a great idea.

Wouldn't that remove the fdisk step and prevent the use of a totally
unconditioned target?

> And some questions:
> Is there some reason that /var is linked under /dev ?

Yes, /var is a 'scrap' area for the most part that needs to be writable.
Since devices take 0 filespace but 1 inode each I found it made a lot of
sense to build a ramdisk to contain both filesystems. Since some system
binaries expect devices to live in /dev it is not possible to symlink /dev
without breaking things. By linking /var under /dev a lot less space is
required than building a /dev ramdisk individually.

Because we need fstab twice along with a bunch of other files. All the
initrd does is uncompress the ramdisks images into ram. I think it might
be possible to do without initrd and move these tsks into rc.init. Not
sure, though. Anyhow, here's how we boot...

1.  Load the initrd image into ram (I think it comes first)
2.  Load the kernel
3.  Execute the kernel
4.  Mount initrd
5.  Execute linuxrc
   a. decompress ramdisk images into ram
   b. point kernel to new and final root device
   Note: initrd needs to contain any libs, devices, etc used by linuxrc
6.  kernel mounts final root filesystem read-only
7.  init is started and executes rc.init
8.  rc.init mounts ramdisks
9.  rc.init executes /etc/rc.sysinit

Around number 7 things get hairy: 
  Init requires /etc/inittab
  We need to have a console
  rc.init requires devices 
  Mount requires an /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab

BUT, when init is executed the contents of the /etc directory still reside
in an unmounted ramdisk as do the devices.

So we need to create and duplicate anything that's needed prior to /etc,
/dev and /var being mounted on the root filesystem. Hence, we need fstab
created for the /etc ramdisk and again for the root filesystem.

It was my idea of possibly doing a dd or something like that to save
anything written to /home if so desired. No specific reason, perhaps not
even desired, just a thought of possibly saving the contents of /home on a
running system.

This is very interesting. The read-only ramdisk target defenitely need
improvement and your idea of making it completely configurable is great.

I hit 2 big stumbling blocks. One that came up is the calculation of
filesystem sizes: How do you determine a filesystem size independent from
the block size of the development system? How can the filesystem size be
calculated more acurately.

Some devices and files are needed on the read-only root before the
ramdisks are mounted and available. This list is different for every
application. How can this be made more flexible?

Some points to keep in mind:

/var and /dev need to be writable. Period. So combining both in a common
ramdisk might sound inflexible but makes a lot of sense when you consider
that 50 devices require 50 inodes containing nothing.  Considering minimal
filesystem requirements it becomes a waste of space, especially if those
50 inodes can be easily provided for in an existing ramdisk without
sacrifice and additional space requirements.

Portions of /etc need to writeable. For ease of maintenance and
configuration changes I created an independent ramdisk. It could as well
be another symlink into the /dev/var ramdisk.

I think I ran into problems running X if /root or /home/<username> wasn't
writable. Don't remember. Again this could be its own ramdisk or a
symlinks.

I don't know what happens the next few days. I am on a days notice for a 2
day trip which will happen during the next few days. If I don't have to go
anywhere this weekend there will be time to look at the funtiones you send
over and make some comments.

Hi,

PeeWeeLinux 0.60.0 is now available. There hasn't been any significant
change from 0.53.27. The 2.2.14 kernel has been removed and a revised
2.2.17 kernel has been build in anticipation of the custom kernel build
function in pwlconfig.

TTYL,
Adi

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10101270217180.20764-100000@big.adis.on.ca>

Hi,

A new PeeWeeLinux beta release is now available! Version 0.60.1 includes
the new kernel build feature in pwlconfig. This will allow for a custom
kernel package to be build right from within the pwlconfig environment.
The updated pwlconfig files can be found at http://peeweelinux.org/pub/Projects/Embedded/peeweelinux-0.60.1-cfg.tar.gz 

Important: 0.60.1 is a beta release! The kernel distributed with the
0.60.x release is a must. If an earlier release is updated the kernel
build will fail. In this case the RPMS/kernel-source-2.2.17-* file should
be replaced with the kernel sources found here: http://peeweelinux.org/pub/Projects/Embedded/Embedded_Build/RPMS/kernel-source-2.2.17-11.i386.rpm

TTYL,
Adi
