<PRE>I am interested in trying out the PeeWeeLinux project.  I got the binary
distribution (0.50), I've read the document (labeled 0.19) which comes with it
and also the BootDisk HOWTO.

I unpacked the archive and I've run (as root) pwlconfig, and it seems to run.
But there's a message printed to stdout or stderr which says:
	....Packages not found

And as I try to follow the quick reference, I can select &quot;Configure Project
File System&quot;, but the menu doesn't display any files within the package.  I'm
stopped there.

I tried to poke around the menus a bit, but I got repeated errors on stderr
which said:
	find: ./packages: No such file or directory

Is there something out of sync here?  It looks in the pwlconfig script that it
expects a directory Packages which contains tarballs.  But this package has
all RPM files, and there's no references to RPM files in the pwlconfig script.

Any hints?

No, my friend, the way to have good and safe government, is not to trust it
all to one, but to divide it among the many, distributing to every one exactly
the functions he is competent to.  It is by dividing and subdividing these
republics from the national one down through all its subordinations, until it
ends in the administration of every man's farm by himself; by placing under
every one what his own eye may superintend, that all will be done for the
best.
