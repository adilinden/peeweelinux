<PRE>Hi,

I've got a minimalistic embedded linux system developed from peeweelinux (0.51). It was done with pwlconfig. I had to add a couple of libs manually, otherwise it would not boot up (libncurses.so.4 and libtermcap.so.2), but it does now. It resides in the HD, boots up, and let's me login with &quot;root&quot; or &quot;admin&quot;.(not much more, as yet)

Feeling brave, I attempted the next step with the ultimate goal of booting from a CF disk: booting from a ram disk. I first tried the tool that comes with pwlconfig (rd_dialog), but it keeps asking me for a project, and while it recognises the name of the last one (the ever present &quot;simple&quot;), no matter what I do or write, can't go past this point. I am probably doing something wrong, but don't know what it is, so I've tried to do it manually (I've done it successfully b4 with another / and
kernel). I mounted the ram disk, copied the fs into it, unmount it, created the image, compress it, edit lilo to refer to this new image, and reboot. After a couple of glitches (it never likes /devram1, whilst /dev/ram0 is okay ...?), the system boots, mounts the fs into ram, and gives me the peewee prompt ... but I can't login using &quot;root&quot; or &quot;admin&quot; like before! I don't know why. It is exactly the same image and kernel as the one residing in the HD, so passwd and permissions are the same. But
it does not go past the login screen. Any pointers? 
 
thanks in advance

Jaime
