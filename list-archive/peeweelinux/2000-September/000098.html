</I>&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> I've got a minimalistic embedded linux system developed from peeweelinux (0.51). It was done with pwlconfig. I had to add a couple of libs manually, otherwise it would not boot up (libncurses.so.4 and libtermcap.so.2), but it does now. It resides in the HD, boots up, and let's me login with &quot;root&quot; or &quot;admin&quot;.(not much more, as yet)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Feeling brave, I attempted the next step with the ultimate goal of booting from a CF disk: booting from a ram disk. I first tried the tool that comes with pwlconfig (rd_dialog), but it keeps asking me for a project, and while it recognises the name of the last one (the ever present &quot;simple&quot;), no matter what I do or write, can't go past this point. I am probably doing something wrong, but don't know what it is, 
</I>

found out: select the &quot;number&quot; of the project. I feel a bit stupid now, 'cause it just did not cross my mind. But here is my admission, in case somebody is stuck on the same thing ( probably not ... ;-) )


so I've tried to do it manually (I've done it successfully b4 with another / and
&gt;<i> kernel). I mounted the ram disk, copied the fs into it, unmount it, created the image, compress it, edit lilo to refer to this new image, and reboot. After a couple of glitches (it never likes /devram1, whilst /dev/ram0 is okay ...?), the system boots, mounts the fs into ram, and gives me the peewee prompt ... but I can't login using &quot;root&quot; or &quot;admin&quot; like before! I don't know why. It is exactly the same image and kernel as the one residing in the HD, so passwd and permissions are the same. But
</I>&gt;<i> it does not go past the login screen. Any pointers?
</I>

still stuck on that one though! I'll try rd_dialog and see what happens.

thanks in advance

Jaime
