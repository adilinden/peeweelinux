<PRE>Hi all!

I have a bizarre problem that I'm hoping someone has seen before, or perhaps
might have a workaround.  I have peeweelinux-0.50-bin.tar.gz, and I've
installed it at work and at home.  Both machines are running a basic RHL6.1
system.  The one at work is running just fine.  But I am trying to Extract the
rpm files into the package directory.  When I try to do so, though, the
extraction process gets stuck at the dev*.rpm package.

It doesn't freeze, for I can watch the rpm process consuming time and nearly
100% of the processor, but I just get the &quot;Extracting ... dev...rpm.&quot; message.
The additional &quot;.&quot; never appear and it just sits there indefinately.

Very strange, indeed!

Has anyone else ever heard of this or seen it?  Is there a way I can work
around it and get the packages all unpacked?

Thanks for any help!

-Michael

No, my friend, the way to have good and safe government, is not to trust it
all to one, but to divide it among the many, distributing to every one exactly
the functions he is competent to.  It is by dividing and subdividing these
republics from the national one down through all its subordinations, until it
ends in the administration of every man's farm by himself; by placing under
every one what his own eye may superintend, that all will be done for the
best.
