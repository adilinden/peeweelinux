<PRE>Well, my 2 cents ...

I tried to get pwl to work as a similar platform and eventually gave up. I
ended up doing a fresh install of RH 9 and stripping it back. I need to
strip more or figure out pwl better, but for now it works.

The pros:

It is quick and relatively simple to do
Easy to replicate if you need to start all over
I have it all fitting on a 128 mb CF card (I have perl, apache and a few
other RPMs installed too, you can probably fit it on a smaller one)

The cons: 
You need at least 500 MB to do a minimal install from the RH 9 CDs.
There are a lot of superfluous programs and files installed.


What I did was to install everything to a 512 mb CF, strip it down and then
cp everything to a smaller CF, run lilo on it and swap it out.

 
All The Best,

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Project: Linux powered picture frame. PWL a good
match?

Hi all,

    I am in the process of making my own digital picture frame using an old
laptop (IBM Thinkpad X20).  Here's basically what I want the system to do on
bootup:

	1 - Load the system into RAM
	2 - Initialize the WiFi LAN card (Prism based) and get a DHCP
address (or static, not too important which)
	3 - Mount an NFS partition
	4 - Start a slideshow using 'zgv' and SVGAlib reading jpg's from the
NFS mounted dir
	5 - Continue step 4 until the universe collapses.

The Thinkpad has been fitted with a 128MB CF card and adaptor. It is
successfully booting to a DOS prompt currently.  I have another X20 laptop
which I plan to use as a development system for this project. It is ideally
suited IMHO since it has Redhat 9 installed and a built in CF slot.

I dont know if PWL is really suited for this or not.  I cant find much about
it's WiFi PCMCIA support in the archives.  My other idea is to strip down a
RH9 install and use a heavily stripped down kernel.  I am reading the
bootdisk HOW-TO and it doesnt seem extremely complicated, but I dont want to
re-invent the wheel or delay the project so long I forget about it (like a
lot of my projects end up &lt;sigh&gt;).

What do you all recommend?

-Ken
