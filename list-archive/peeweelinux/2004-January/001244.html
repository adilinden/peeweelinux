<PRE>Thanks for the great help from Ashley Rolleston and Ken Emmons.

Here is my little poor experience :-)  :

Now i am using a PCM5335-B10 PC/104 board as platform. and it has a 
CompactFlash socket, treats it as HardDisk.

Of course, I am using SanDisk 64MB CF card. My expericence is that don't use 
a flash multi-reader, using a single CF card reader ( SDDR-91 USB reader ) 
makes things easier.

RedHat 9 didn't support PeeWeeLinux well, it always made installation 
failure. The Redhat 7 is a very nice version for PeeWee.

Powered by PeeWeeLinux, the development became really easy. As i got 
bootx.tgz, I only tried twice of installation and then the system could run 
on the board!

As PCM5335-B10 is a poewerful PC/104 board, and it supports CF strongly,  I 
used &quot;Read-Write as root on Single partition&quot;, and boots fast.

Now, here are some questions again:

Teacher asked me do a application on it. And the application have to use 
Imlib and GTK+, since the CF card still a lot space left (about 45MB), i 
wanna these libraries included on my target Linux.

I tried application once, the error is:

libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0
libgdk_imbib.so.1

Can anybody tell me how to do it? Thank you :-)
