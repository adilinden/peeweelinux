Message-ID: <20030303103002.21826.qmail@web41408.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi

I installed peeweelinux on a bootable flashdisk. I
don't know why the passwords don't work. I tried
admin/admin and root/redhat. what is wrong ?

After booting, I would like peewee to log automaticly
under root user. Is there a way to do that ?

Thank you

hello,
I tried out a small linux from scratch for a pc/104. Everything works fine on the host but definitly doesn't on the embedded system. I have an ide adapter for a pc-card. Lilo wouldn't install on the flash so I tried syslinux and loadlin by using a small fat filesystem at the beginning of the flash pc card. At boot time, the kernel is uncompressed but then the system just reboots. I can't figure out what to do...
Any idea about that??

thanks in advance
François

I forgot...

I'm not sure these information are important :

- I'm using red Hat 8.0
- I need peewee linux on a flash disk
- I install peewee linux on an another comuter using a
micro linux distribution, transfering peewee and
installing lilo.

hi,
I suppose you're French, but in doubt I'll answer in english ;)
I don't know much about peeweelinux, so I'll tell you what I would try...
1)Concerning the root password problem:
edit the file etc/shadow (should be in ...Embedded_Build/projects/minimal/mnt/etc or something similar). There you should find a line like this:
root:$1$suMKaTdx$f34uNmwell.xiznODhCka0:11970:0:99999:7::: or admin or whatever...
(this one's fake of course :) )
now erase the characters $1$suMKaTdx$f34uNmwell.xiznODhCka0 and save the file. Once you reboot you'll just have to login as root without any password and then put one by using passwd.

2)to login directly as root:
in the file etc/inittab you should have a line such as:
c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1 linux
which loads the program getty (login program) and again after you close a session.
It concerns console number 1. So if you don't want this just erase this line and add something like sh or bash at the end of the rc.M script.

hope this helps,
François

I've solved the su problem.
Just copy tinylogin to another dir, and chmod it to 4755.
Then link it to su.
Ok! Just run this su to become root!

ps : /etc/securetty must add pts/1.
      If use telnet, must add ppty0.

I need perl to run modules of my real-time kernel
(RTAI). Unfortunatly, it is not availible with peewee.
If I try to copy the equest files from my other
computer (redhat 8.0), I have a problem of version
incompatibility.

What should I do?

Subject: [Peeweelinux] problems getting rcS.d/10network to run dhcpcd
Message-ID: <se7888a5.065@qatech.com>

Hello,

I am trying to get dhcpcd to manage my interface at bootup. 

The network script in rcS.d has a function like this:

###start of snippet ###

ifup ()
{
    if [ "$BOOTPROTO" = "dhcp" ]; then
        if [ -f /sbin/pump ]; then
            # If we have pump we prefer it to get an ip number
            echo -n "Determining IP information for $DEVICE...."
            if /sbin/pump -i $DEVICE ; then
                echo " done...."
            else
                echo " failed...."
            fi
        elif [ -f /sbin/dhcpcd ]; then
            # Try to use dhcpcd
            echo -n "Determining IP information for $DEVICE...."
            if /sbin/dhcpcd $DEVICE ; then
                echo " done...."
            else
                echo "failed...."
            fi
        else

###end of snippet

I can't seem to find where BOOTPROTO is set or configured. I could edit this script, but why do it if I can remain vanilla?

Thanks Adi,

putting this in my "custom/etc/config/ifcfg-eth0" file solved it:

DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Disposition: inline

Hello,

The initial Autoboot project with X windows support has been reworked. =
I've attached it to the email.=20

Hopefully users can try this project out and it will give them a great =
starting point with developing their own project, as a lot of the figuring =
out of dependencies and such have been taken care of. I'd like to get some =
feedback so that I can improve it for my own needs, and so others can =
benefit form it.=20

 What you get with this project is a pretty complete system with vi, grep, =
more, bash, XFree86, top, network with optional DHCP. Pretty much =
everything I can think of that one might need to have a not-very-deeply-emb=
edded-system. OK, OK, so you don't have emacs and Mozilla, but what do you =
want in a system that compresses to 5.5MB of flash disk space! With =
CompactFlash costing pennies these days this is pretty reasonable. Youc an =
probably find people throwing away their 8MB cards.=20

The way it works out of the box is to boot up and run normal scripts, and =
then su to a normal user, which then runs x windows (twm and xterm). I =
have defined this as another runlevel in inittab, specifically runlevel 4. =
I insert the module for my intel etherexpress network card and run dhcp =
daemon to configure my IP address. You can tailor all of this behaviour by =
modifying the files in the ./custom folder of the project. Here is a =
breakdown of what to do:

1) Unpack peeweelinux 0.61.1. (If you already are using 0.61.1 skip to =
step 4...)
2) cd Embedded_Build
3) mkdir projects

4) cd projects
5) tar -xzvf  <your path to the bootx project>/bootx.tgz
6) cd ..
7) ./pwlconfig

Answer the prompts to unpack tar files if it appears. Change projects to =
bootx if necessary. Choose the option to extract the filesystem for the =
project.=20

You should now be ready to build this project to flash. I recommend trying =
it out and see if it works before modifying what is in the project. You =
may have to change your target hardware config (I have the flash disk =
attached to my sandisk reader at /dev/sda ).=20

After verifying that you can autoboot to x windows (It uses VGA16, so you =
should get it to work with any VGA card at first.) you may want to go in =
and configure your particulars.=20

Network config:
************
1) Change your network module. I use the eepro100 module for my intel =
card. You can change this in the kernel-full package list for your =
specific card.=20
2) Edit the custom/etc/rc.modules file for the network module that you =
just selected.=20
3) If you don't have a DHCP server attached to your LAN, edit the file =
custom/etc/config/ifcfg-eth0 for your static IP address and such. (for an =
example, see the autogenerated file in the mnt/etc/config/ifcfg-eth0 =
file).=20

Of course if you don't have a NIC, just delete all network related =
packages in pwlconfig.=20

Stopping X windows from firing up at boot (i.e. normal autoboot to =
console.)
*************************************************************
1) go to custom/home/autologin/.bashrc file and comment out the line that =
says "startx".=20

Making your custom application fire up at boot.
**************************************
1) If it is an X app (probably static linked if using GTK or other =
toolkit) you want edit the sutom/home/autologin/.xinitrc file. Comment out =
the lines for xterm and twn and put in a line for your application.=20
2) If it is a console app, just add it to your .bashrc file.=20

I've included the Xfree86 Framebuffer driver in addition to the VGA16 =
driver. I haven't been successful in getting this to work, so if anybody =
has any insight into doing this it would be appreciated. Ultimately having =
a framebuffer basic config that runs on almost all VGA hardware would be =
desireable since we can get more than 16 colors potentially. This may not =
be possible but I am holding out hope for it. You can build multiple NICs =
into kernels, but I hate to maintain different peewee images just for =
video hardware!=20

I hope this helps some people out, and don't be afraid to comment on it =
and report bugs.=20

~Ken

Subject: [Peeweelinux] initrd problem
Message-ID: <1048438077.27612.43.camel@ralph.plexio.private>

Hi,

In following Mark Meade's PeeWee Linux on DiskOnChip instructions
(http://lakeshoremicro.com/peeweedoc.txt), I've managed to load PeeWee
0.61.1 and lilo-mtd onto the DOC. During startup, lilo from the DOC
starts and boots the custom kernel (2.4.20) but it ends up using the
root fs from /dev/hda. Here's a snippet of the kernel message:

RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
Freeing initrd memory: 1152k freed
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem).
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Trying to move old root to /initrd ... failed
Unmounting old root
Trying to free ramdisk memory ... okay
Freeing unused kernel memory: 264k freed

Is there some setting within pwlconfig I can adjust to fix the initrd
problem?

Thanks,
Stephen

Does your root ext2 file system have an empty
directory called '/initrd' on it that the
kernel can use a mount point?

I think I did. I created a /initrd under
./Embedded_Build/projects/DOC-Test/mnt and added initrd/ to
filesystem.list and reloaded onto the DOC. It didn't seem to make a
difference. I then disconnected the harddrive and rebooted with just the
DOC. This was more revealing. Here is the last of the kernel messages:

VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem)
Kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k block-major-3, errno = 2
VFS: Cannot open root device or 03:06
Please append a correct "root=" boot option.
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:06

The kernel (2.4.20) was compiled with ide support having the following
kernel config bits:

CONFIG_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y

It looks like the kernel cannot read the root fs even though IDE support
is part of the kernel. Is this a lilo, kernel or DOC (2000) problem?

Thanks,
Stephen

Subject: [Peeweelinux] nfs with peewee, kernel 2.4.20
Message-ID: <se7eea04.021@qatech.com>

Hello,

I am using kernel 2.4.20  (with RTAI patches). I have built the kernel custom and put it in the custom/boot directory. I have put my modules in the appropriate place in custom/lib. 

I have built nfs into my custom kernel and am subsequently trying to mount an nfs filesystem off of my debian server machine. 

I modified the peewee fstab manually and checked off not to generate boot files. 

when I try to mount the nfs export the mount command hangs, and I am able to switch to another terminal and run dmesg, which reports the following:

begin***

NFS: NFSv3 not supported.
nfs warning: mount version older than kernel.
 hda:hda1
 hda:hda1
portmap: server localhost not responding, timed out.

***end

The NFSv3 message I can see is possibly because I didn't enable v3 support in my custom kernel. The mount message kind of worries me, and I am not sure if it is the culprit or not. 

I am not sure what the timeout message means, but I ran ifconfig and got the following from lo device:

begin***
inet addr: 127.0.0.1     Mask:255.0.0.0
UP LOOPBACK RUNNING
***end

etc etc...

I am not sure where to start debugging this. I tried copying a new version of mount, but it is dynamically linked to GLIBC 2.2, so I can't use it. 

any ideas are appreciated.

~Ken

You either need to build a statically linked mount or build it on a RedHat 
6.x machine that uses the same libs as PeeWeeLinux.

I'm not an NFS master or anything, but don't you have to run "rpc.lockd" 
as a daemon on any NFS client before trying to mount a remote server?  I 
think portmap is for servers only, so that shouldn't be needed.

On all my redhat NFS clients here, rpc.lockd/rpc.statd is part of 
nfs-utils, and has to be started before I can mount any remote NFS 
shares. I would expect PWL to be the same...?

rpc.lockd is for providing file locking on files in file systems
mounted via NFS.  It's been a while but I do not think you have
to have rpc.lockd running to use NFS.  Of course things could
have changed.

I've compiled a 2.4.20 kernel with no modules and still have the same
problem. Does anyone have a DOC2000-ready kernel (2.4.2x) with no
dependent modules for PWL I could try? I want to eliminate the kernel as
a source of my bootup problem.

Thanks,

Stephen,

I don't have a kernel handy, but I can tell you that I have been able to boot 
from a DOC2000 with a 2.4.19 kernel and the appropriate MTD options enabled 
(compiled-in, not as modules).  I used both GRUB and LILO -- Grub is my 
personal perference, but using LILO is easier under Peewee.

In your first email, you mentioned that you used dformat or fdisk to install 
a FAT12 partition on the DOC.  If you are trying to boot from this partition, 
do you have FAT support compiled into your kernel?

Hi Mark,

Yes I do (CONFIG_FAT_FS=y). Actually, I ended up following your
suggestion and used the 4.2 DFORMAT and in the end it worked and 5.12
did not. Here again is the kernel error after lilo starts the kernel:

VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem)
Kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k block-major-3, errno = 2
VFS: Cannot open root device or 03:06
Please append a correct "root=" boot option.
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:06

Is this a sign of missing FS support or a more fundamental problem of
the IDE driver not working? I wonder if I should try 2.4.19 instead?

Thanks,
Stephen

Hello,

Is there a portmap package for peewee? Everything I have been reading seems to point out that an NFS client needs to have portmap running in order to work properly. The 2.4.20 kernel config, however only mentions that the only additional package needed is TCP ... hmmm.

Has anyone had luck running peewee with a NFS share? Did you need portmap, and if so how do you get it?

Hi,

Sorry for that last email. After many many google searches I finally stumbled onto something interesting. My problem was that my mount command woudl hang for several minutes.

With a 2.4 kernel (and possibly other kernels...) compiled with NFS support for client, all you need is to configure fstab to NOT use the lockd program. So, in your fstab options, pass mount the "nolock" option and now you can mount and unmount NFS shares with peewee...

It sounds like you didn't build your kernel with all the required FS support. Try to enable anything that is questionably needed, and recompile. Also, make sure to build the FS support statically (NOT as modules...). 

I havne't done a DOC linux app, so I apologize if this is not relevant. Usually when you can't mount root, it is a FS issue though.

Sorry for all the traffic folks. It turns out that I shouldn't have
copied over boot.b along with lilo-mtd from the mtd cvs directory. Once
the original pwl boot.b was restored, the very welcoming Peewee login
prompt appeared. 

Thanks for all the support.

How do I go about saving changes made within PWL? For example, I made
changes to lilo.conf in PWL (on the target box) and would like to commit
them to the DOC. Is there such a script?

you can try out changes using RAMDISK on the target machine, but you will loose them on reboot. 

If you want to keep something, put it in the "custom" directory within your project. If there doesn't exist one, simply make one. The root of the directory "custom" gets copied over the root filesystem, so if you have an entry named etc/passwd in your cusotm file, it will get copied to /etc on your target. 

As far as lilo.conf, this is generated by ./pwlconfig, so you will have to let us know a little more about what you are trying to do. If you ismply want to append a string to the kernel boot, you can do that in the target config in ./pwlconfig.

I would like the user on the thin client box to be able to make
adjustments to lilo.conf have them stick. The boxes call nfsroot mount
from lilo to connect to the server. Unfortunately the nfs server IP
needs to be hard coded into the kernel boot parameter specified in
lilo.conf thus if the nfs server ip changes, the user needs to adjust
the value in lilo.conf.

One hack I have used in the past for this sort of problem has been to link 
the conf file to a file on a volume they can edit. Keep in mind that this 
introduces a major security vulnerability, I really think you're asking 
for trouble having the users mess around with lilo.conf. I'm wondering if 
there isn't some way to set up a DHCP style relay to handle the IP 
mappings?

I agree 100% but unfortunately I don't have much say in the matter. I'll
likely let their admins worry about making sure the nfs server IP never
changes ;-)

Back to the original problem and to satisfy my curiosity, is it feasible
to unpack the ramdisk image, modify it and then repack it within PWL?

I tried in the config file to comment the section of

Linking lilo.conf and writing a C program that changes the IP and writes it to the file, then run LILO will probably work. All you would need is to then include the LILO package and your custom C code.

Is it fvmw that is not loading? Does anybody have any
suggestion.


Does it worth it to try to install tinyX instead of Xfree86?

If you want to scope this one out, you'll have to look at the output from 
the server. Do the following:

startx >& logfile

then press ctrl-alt-backspace to get you out of the server

then type:

more logfile

and take a look at what the errors are. Usually stuff like this is from 
problems with your mouse or video card.

Another thing you can check out is to type:

ps -fu root

and see whether xfs is running. If it's not, check under /etc/X11/fs (or 
something like that) to see whether the directories (under catalog) in the 
config file actually exist and are linked to real files. If not, delete 
the offending entries, and then try restarting your machine and seeing if 
xfs is starting up. You need it in order to get X working.

FORGET MY PREVIOUS MAIL.

Finally, I got XFree and fvwm working with the numbers
of the keyboard as an emulator of the mouse.

I have one problem left. My screen is in a shitty
resolution (320x240) and the display is bigger than my
computer screen, so unusable. I edited the config file
of XFree and removed everything with a resolution
under 800x600, but my display didn't changed.

What should I do to see the complete display and to
have a better resolution?

Sorry if I'm sending a lot of messages, I have to
finish this distribution for next week.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20030331092945.027788d8@mail.atavia.com>

  I am trying to move my Peewee install to 2.4.  I have gotten the compat* 
packages, and installed them.  I made the necessary changes to the kernel 
Makefile (changed gcc to kgcc and added the -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH) to the 
CC variable). I sourced the i386-glibc21-linux-env.sh script.  everything 
compiles just fine, and then I created a custom kernel package, with the 
/dev nodes I need.  Then I deploy to the compact flash, which also goes 
well.  The problem is that my kernel appears to load and then immediately 
after load, it prints a short message and reboots.  I can't read the 
message, it flashes by very quickly.  I can pick out that it is printing 
the normal 'Decompressing Linux'  message.  If I use a 2.2 kernel, 
everything goes just fine.

   Any help that anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.
      Thanks

Have you tried compiling your custom 2.4 kernel on a distribution
already capable of running 2.4? I did most of my Peewee development on a
Redhat7.1 box as I didn't need to build any new packages other than the
kernel itself and there was no obvious compatibility problems.

Your suggestion has gotten my package to boot on a celeron, but still 
refuses to boot on the via C3 system that is my ultimate target.  I am 
still not sure what the problem is on the via system, but I am pretty sure 
that it is a kernel setting, so I will keep plugging.

Try compiling your kernel with console redirection support, attach it to 
something with Minicom running and let that term capture the output. 
Even though you don't have a proper getty to actually support logins 
over console, the capture up until that point should show you the 
problem.... (I've debugged a few nefarious problems this way...)

You might also want to try turning off initrd and checking the root 
settings on lilo. To me it sounds like it boots fine but can't find the 
root image.

Presumably you've chosen the CryixIII/C3 processor in the kernel
configuration?

Yes, along these same lines, try cahnging your target config to be a read only root filesystem with multiple ram disks, in the .pwlconfig target setup menu. this might give you some clues to whether or not the initrd support in the kernel is giving you problems. 

It is a bit strange that it boots on one machine and not the other though...

Hello,

I have been trying to track down why my nfs filesystem is not mounted by root at bootup. I am able to mount it manually as root no problem. 

It seems that the rc.sysinit script which performs the "mount -a" command is executed before the rc scripts, so my network is not up at the point the mount command is processed, therefore my nfs is not mounted. 

Is there a post sysinit script that can be used for this purpose?

Create a file named something like "30nfsmount", mode 0755, that is simply:

#!/bin/sh
/bin/mount -a -t nfs

Obviously, make sure it's numbered at least one step higher than your 
networking config. (I've completely rewritten the networking 
initialization, so don't remember the defaults...)

Then add this file as a custom file that gets put into /etc/rcS.d/ upon 
build. Increase it's complexity as necessary...
