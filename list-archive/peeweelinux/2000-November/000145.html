<PRE>Hi Adi,

</I>
In PWL the response is the same, whether my code being started from init or from an interactive shell after loggin in. Hence, in the development system in RH6.1 I have not bother testing from init, since it works from a shell.  I believe it should work from the (PWL) shell first (as it does in RH6.1), and then I'll worry about starting from init (from all the mails that I got back as an answer to this problem, I believe I know how to work that out ... once the application works from the (PWL)
shell). One step at a time.


&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> pwlconfig scripts. The kernel has been upgraded to 2.2.17 and some minor

</I>

I was focused on getting my stuff working, and I don't think is the kernel, so I haven't updated yet. Also, there were quite a few buggy scripts reports that seem to be sorted now, so I will give it a shot soon.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> recreate your problem...
</I>
Right now the application is kinda biggish (a few threads and shared areas of memo), so I'll try and get a cut down version with the problem. Any pointers welcome meanwhile. 

Thanks

Jaime

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've sent a few posting lately regarding signal catching during
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; booting-up (see messages above, in Nov'00), only to realise that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem I am having is not specific to the boot-up process but seems to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be general to PWL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Essentially, I am writing an application that needs catching a signal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sent by the user. I dont't need a shell, being an embedded application,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I have chosen SIGQUIT (typing Ctrl+\ in kdb, but it could also easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be SIGINT, by typing CTRL+C). The application has been writen in a RH6.1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development machine with kernel 2.2.12, and static libraries linked into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it. It works fine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, I have PeeWeeLinux 0.51, which casually seems to be based on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same system (RH6.1). I've got it working fine. Boots up, gives me the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prompt, loging in. No probs. Now, if I run my application (previosly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copied accross from the dev machine), it starts fine, and works fine,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but never catches the signal, i.e., loops forever. While this is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behaviour that will exhibit in the future, when it is a proper embedded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system, during development is proving a pain to have to shutdown the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system (ctrl+alt+del works, hence that signal is being cought by init, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guess) to terminate the application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can't quite work out the reason. Maybe I should link something else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in PWL? maybe upgrading to 0.53 will solve it? (does not seem the reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to me, though)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any wild guesses? Thanks very much in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jaime
