<PRE>Hi,

When you say it works fine on the development system, are you starting it
from init on your redhat 6.1 system just as you do in PWL?

The majority of changes between 0.51 and 0.53 are relating to the
pwlconfig scripts. The kernel has been upgraded to 2.2.17 and some minor
packages were added.

Do you have a sample application to 'play' with? Then I can see if I can
recreate your problem...

TTYL,
Adi

&gt;<i> I've sent a few posting lately regarding signal catching during
</I>&gt;<i> booting-up (see messages above, in Nov'00), only to realise that the
</I>&gt;<i> problem I am having is not specific to the boot-up process but seems to
</I>&gt;<i> be general to PWL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Essentially, I am writing an application that needs catching a signal
</I>&gt;<i> sent by the user. I dont't need a shell, being an embedded application,
</I>&gt;<i> so I have chosen SIGQUIT (typing Ctrl+\ in kdb, but it could also easily
</I>&gt;<i> be SIGINT, by typing CTRL+C). The application has been writen in a RH6.1
</I>&gt;<i> development machine with kernel 2.2.12, and static libraries linked into
</I>&gt;<i> it. It works fine. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I have PeeWeeLinux 0.51, which casually seems to be based on the
</I>&gt;<i> same system (RH6.1). I've got it working fine. Boots up, gives me the
</I>&gt;<i> prompt, loging in. No probs. Now, if I run my application (previosly
</I>&gt;<i> copied accross from the dev machine), it starts fine, and works fine,
</I>&gt;<i> but never catches the signal, i.e., loops forever. While this is the
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour that will exhibit in the future, when it is a proper embedded
</I>&gt;<i> system, during development is proving a pain to have to shutdown the
</I>&gt;<i> system (ctrl+alt+del works, hence that signal is being cought by init, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess) to terminate the application. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't quite work out the reason. Maybe I should link something else
</I>&gt;<i> in PWL? maybe upgrading to 0.53 will solve it? (does not seem the reason
</I>&gt;<i> to me, though)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any wild guesses? Thanks very much in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jaime
