</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have some answers...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am experiencing the following with PWL0.53.10:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) when I tried to extract a file system to a CompactFlash IDE target
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; device (/dev/hdc) from pwlconfig, I always get the following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;testing that nothing is mounted on mount directory&quot; ...failed
</I>
This happens to me if the device is mounted prior to loading the
filesystem onto the CF device. Do a umount /dev/hdc first and the
problem should go away.
 
&gt;<i> Seeing that rd_dialog works, the actual script that loads the filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> is alright. What do you see when you go to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Configure Target Hardware --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did pwlconfig ask you to create a new configuration file (it should have)
</I>&gt;<i> when you tried to load your target? All I can think of is that the path to
</I>&gt;<i> the temporary mount directory is not correct. It should say something
</I>&gt;<i> like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Device Mount Point: &quot;./mnt&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b) On another note, the minimal configuration example that comes with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PWL0.53.10 tries to extract, as kernel,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ./packages/Kernel/kernel-basic-2.2.17.list, which does not exist (at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; least not in the distro I have). Hence,, the system generated does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a kernel. Furthermore, I have noticed that even If you select
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another kernel, project.conf always includes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ./packages/Kernel/kernel-basic-2.2.17.list, hence the error is also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generated, despite your selected kernel included okay (that happens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whenever your project is based on &quot;minimal&quot;. If you start your new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project from the scratch, it does not happen).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did you upgrade to 0.53.10 by downloading the peeweelinux-*-cfg.tar.gz
</I>&gt;<i> package or did you download the complete bin or src archive?
</I>
I've just recently seen that same error and I haven't tried the example
configurations. I have however just re-installed the original 0.53 then
0.53-8 and then 0.53-10.

Another minor annoyance that I've noticed is that if a 'load target'
fails, any subsequent attempt within the same pwlconfig session will
also report a failure, even if the load succeeded. This appears to be a
case of the failure flag not being cleared in the beginning of the load
script.
