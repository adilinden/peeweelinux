Subject: [Peeweelinux] Upgrading XFree86 in peewee
Message-ID: <00b101c3ff97$c0f6a500$2101a8c0@SATPRO>

Hi all,

Does anyone have experience with upgrading the XFree86 package that comes
with peewee? I would like to upgrade it to 4.3.0. I have already upgraded my
kernel to 2.4.18. What are the main steps towards accomplishing the XFree86
upgrade?

Any help would be appreciated, I have searched through the archives, but I
cannot find much of relevance.

Thanks,

I think maybe I should elaborate slightly as my last post seems quite
vague... Sorry for the double post.

I am familiar with peeweelinux and the stock XFree86 that is supplied 'Out
of the Box'. I have had these working with previous versions of hardware.
Now I am using new embedded hardware (the vortex-6047 www.vortex86.com)
which uses a SiS550 chip and need to upgrade XFree86 to get the drivers
working.

Specifically I am not sure about the best way to install the Xfree86
glibc2.1 precompiled binaries that I have with the peeweelinux setup? Should
I use a method similar to creating a custom_kernel package? If so are there
any issues disabling the supplied XFree86?

Thanks, again

Hi Ashley,

My personal approach would be to grab a set of stock Redhat SRPMS that 
contain the driver necessary for your chipset, and then rpm --rebuild 
them on a Redhat 6.2 machine. Preferrably RH7.3 (as it's pretty 
compatible with 6.2), but it appears XFree 4.2.1 is the latest ever made 
for 7.3.

It's probably possible to rebuild the 9.0 SRPM on a 6.2 machine, but you 
may have to tweak it a little. If nothing else, you could extract the 
.spec file from a 9.0 SRPM, and use the compile logic to hand compile 
the 4.3.0 on a Redhat 6.2 box then. I've done this for various packages 
to backport to old servers, tends to work fine. XFree86 is a beast, 
however - may require some handholding.

Then all you need to do is tar it all up to look exactly like the stock 
PWL stuff, add as a custom package and select it. One would think it'd 
be a drop in replacement at that point.

Hi,

I was wondering about the possible implications of setting -b 4096 or -b
1024 on the target load scripts.

Specifically, I'm worried about compact flash usage.

Hmmm, I was intrigued as well -- we use 1024 on the 'extra' ext3 
partition on purpose, as the system records a lot of tiny files. I found 
an interesting thread that would seem to indicate 4096 or 8192 would 
work just fine -- faster, but waste space.

Hi,

Well my peeweelinux project is now all but finished. It's looking great,
using peeweelinux with bootx and an updated kernel, an 800x600 TFT +
touchscreen on a SBC. All my net drivers and touchscreen drivers are
working, although I had to revert to standard vesa framebuffer drivers
together with the XF86_FBDev X server because of a problem with my hardware
configuration and the SiS drivers for my particular graphics/lcd setup.

Together with Netscape and the Flash 5 plug-in this will be used as an easy
to use interface for other hardware (flash still leaves a bad taste in my
mouth though...)

I have one last question on my configuration. I need a driver program in
/usr/bin to run automatically on startup before startx is called. This
driver creates some custom devices in /dev and it appears to need to be ran
as root. I have tried adding the program to .bashrc in /home/autologin but
this doesn't work. I have also tried creating /etc/rc.local , and trying
rc.sysinit.

At the moment the only way is to stop autologin running startx, and manually
'su root' then run the driver program and then exit the root shell and run
startx manually...

Where can I specify in the startup scripts to run this process ?

Thanks for all your help, I will remain subscribed to this list in case I
can help anyone else with the experience I have had.

Hello,

Use the rc.init scripts, they get run as root before running the login stuff. I'm using this to create some devices and load some driver modules, and it works great. I don't know why the scripts you tried didn't work, but in my "custom/etc/rcS.d" folder, I have a script called "99init_sys" that gets run fine. Make sure to have #!/bin/sh at the top of your script and all that fun stuff, and it should work out nicely.

Hi Ashley,

I just read your letter and I'm wondering if you happen to know what 
embedded platform it's possible to install the pee-wee on ?

I'm talking about boards like 8051 and such...

Thanks in advance,

Seth.

I used a vortex-6047 (ICOPtech) single board computer, and before that on
the prototype I was using Advantech hardware. Although they were specified
quite similarly, I encountered very unique problems, mostly driver related.
Therefore if you are looking at possible hardware to use I would go for as
generic a setup as you can (vesa compliant vga, ne2000 compliant net card
etc).

Good luck,

Ashley

 From my end (to maybe help), we use the Advantech PCM-3350 and it works 
"out of the box" with a 2.2/2.4 kernel, no crazy driver issues encountered.

http://www.advantech.com/products/Model_Detail.asp?model_id=1-D6LUW&bu=

NIC: OEM i82557/i82558 10/100 Ethernet (eepro100)
IDE: CS5530 (SanDisk CF chip used as /dev/hdc)

We don't use X, textmode VGA works fine though. A couple other Advantech 
modules are stacked on it (multiport serial, modem, etc) and all are 
100% operational. I will note that very specific DIP switch settings are 
required.
