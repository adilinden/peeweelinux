<PRE>Hi Mark!

&gt;<i> Is it possible that you were in the &quot;root&quot; directory initially?
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; Login as root/redhat.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ls -l returns 'total 0'.
</I>
Bingo! :) Of *course* I was in /root. Set returned a nice PATH at login so
I knew I was basically logged in.

At the time I didn't *think* to *try* to go up the tree. I don't
particularly care how it works as long as I have an idea what it might do
when I push a button. I'd also swear that I tried ls -l /bin and similar
but I might be mistaken.

There're some strange behavior that screwed my head on sideways:

login as root
# pwd
Cannot exec /bin/pwd
# cd /
# pwd
/
# cd root
# pwd
/root

I also did have some truly faulty installs that allowed login but really
did have no filesystem (nothing in ~/projects/~/mnt) and that further
misled my understanding.

Tnx much. Have a :) day!

jb
