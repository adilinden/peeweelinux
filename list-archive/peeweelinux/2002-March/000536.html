<PRE>Hi all, 
        I have looked all over the archives and what has been said has not
helped me fix my problem. My problem is as follows.

I have installed the peewee 0.61 iso and all works great to build . I have a
diskonchip 2000 installed on my redhat 6.2 box that I am using and I can
access it with no problems when I boot up.

My problem is when I tell the pw to send it to /dev/msys/fla it sends it all
untill it gets to the lilo part and then it fails. I have tried copying all
the file and changing the doc.b and doc-lilo but it still does not work.

I really need to get this to work on my 16M diskonchip so any help on how to
do this would be great 

Again I have looked all over the archives so I have to post. I am new to
this but I always try to find answers on my own before I post

So far I am loving peewee and may start to help on writing some new docs for
it as I get better at what I am doing. 

Thanks 
Bob
