<PRE>Hi All!

I date back to the VIC-20/C64/8088-12'turbo'/DOS 3.1 era. Ran a Fido BBS
for about ten years up until four years ago. (I -heard- about Linux 'way
back when' and -wish- I'd tried it then. [sigh]) Ran a Win 3.1 and then
Linux server over dialup for a few years just learning the ropes. Lately
with SDSL/208k (expensive but nice, nice, nice, fast and stable.)

I am *IMPRESSED* with pwl beyond casual words. Have used tomsrtbt a number
of times in the past for crash/rescue purposes and it was perfect for
that. Been looking lately at a few other minimal-linux packages and pwl
seems to be the most advanced and well supported. Tried plip and SETH
extensively without good luck. SETH looked good as a
'tomsrtbt-plus-networking,' but an error regarding 'no /dev/eth0' that's
even mentioned at deja.com with no fix in sight was a tad disturbing. :(
It also looked like a lot of 'work' to fix those kinds of problems and
didn't feel like mucking around so I was elated when I found pwl.

The main reason I need pwl at the moment is to move some legacy files from
an old Win 3.1 box over to another box, then use it plus the CD on the
main server to install redhat via the LAN. Not worth buying and installing
a CD in a PPRO/200.

I'd rate myself as 'very advanced' in Linux. Can
install/setup/troubleshoot almost anything. Hate RPMs, use handrolled
Apache, MySQL, Bind, PHP. There are a few things that still elude my
understanding which is why I'm having some trouble getting pwl to do it's
thing. I'm 99% there but stuck on that last 1%.

Well that's all to explain that I generally know my way around the box.
Will post another msg in a bit with all the gory details of difficulties.

(Oh boy am I gonna miss that 3.1. :( With WinMizer it was *rock* solid
stable, powered up for months at a time without a reboot. Could run
resources down to 0%, just shut off a few apps and keep on ticking. If
only Bill had bought that technology Win would not be the nightmare that
it's always been.)

Have a :) day!
