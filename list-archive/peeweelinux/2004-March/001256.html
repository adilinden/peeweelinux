<PRE>Hi,

Well my peeweelinux project is now all but finished. It's looking great,
using peeweelinux with bootx and an updated kernel, an 800x600 TFT +
touchscreen on a SBC. All my net drivers and touchscreen drivers are
working, although I had to revert to standard vesa framebuffer drivers
together with the XF86_FBDev X server because of a problem with my hardware
configuration and the SiS drivers for my particular graphics/lcd setup.

Together with Netscape and the Flash 5 plug-in this will be used as an easy
to use interface for other hardware (flash still leaves a bad taste in my
mouth though...)

I have one last question on my configuration. I need a driver program in
/usr/bin to run automatically on startup before startx is called. This
driver creates some custom devices in /dev and it appears to need to be ran
as root. I have tried adding the program to .bashrc in /home/autologin but
this doesn't work. I have also tried creating /etc/rc.local , and trying
rc.sysinit.

At the moment the only way is to stop autologin running startx, and manually
'su root' then run the driver program and then exit the root shell and run
startx manually...

Where can I specify in the startup scripts to run this process ?

Thanks for all your help, I will remain subscribed to this list in case I
can help anyone else with the experience I have had.
