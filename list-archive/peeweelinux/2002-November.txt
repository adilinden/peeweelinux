Hi Adi,

I've been swamped the last few weeks so I have not been able to reply to
you.  Could you please tell me what the US price is?  Do you accept
credit cards?

Thanks,
Marc

Hi,

The adapters are CDN$30 and are billed in Canadian Dollar. This is 
equivalent to approx. US$20

Hello all!

It's nice to see people doing embedded linux stuff.
I downloaded the Peewee and gave it a go. I tried it on an embedded
486 board. Looks really good.

However, here is my first question:

Do I have to stay with the built in 2.2.17 kernel?
If it's possible is it better to move on another one? Like 2.2.22?

How can I compare kernel versions? Is it always good to go for a
recent one from kernel.org?

Thanks a lot!

there is a guide to upgrading the kernel in the mailing list archives.
however, if the one includede does what you need, I think you should keep
it, it's stable.

Were you able to use the RH 7.3 packages as is, or did you need to rebuild
them?  I got stalled when I tried using the 2.4 kernel because although
building the kernel itself wasn't too bad, hunting down all the packages
that needed to be upgraded seemed daunting.

Ed,
I was able to run the 2.4 kernel with the existing packages, the only 
thing I changed initially was the kernel, the kernel modules, and the 
modutils package.  I then made sure I could boot the new kernel.  Then I 
upgraded packages as necessary.  The way I upgraded the packages was to 
manually create the tar and list file myself.
For example:
rpm2cpio xxx.rpm | cpio -dim  (extracts a redhat package to the current 
directory)
tar cf xxx.tar *  (tars up all the files in the package)
tar tf xxx.tar > xxx.list ( creates the necessary list file)
copy xxx.tar and xxx.list to the packages directory in peewee linux and 
you're all set.

hello,
it's the first time I give a try to peeweelinux and I hope I won't ask things that have already been answered...
I downloaded the source package and ran the script pwlconfig. Worked fine until the Extract File System for project. I found out about an hour later I had to run the rpm2tar first. Maybe this will help some new comers like me...
Now for my problem: 
I'm trying to boot on a floppy. I get a "sh: PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin: No such file or directory"
I extracted the ramdisk from the floppy mounted it and ran the script rc.init with a chroot. So I could conclude it comes from the rc.init (boy that's only the second line of the script :( ).
and btw, I'm using busybox (<--- it's probably his fault!!)
Has anybody gone through that?

François

Thanks for the responses. The 2.4 kernel tip is really useful.
I am also using a RH7.3 and thinking of upgrading to the
RH7.3 kernel/apps/libs at some point in the future.

My question was also about the kernel versions. I don't have any
link to compare the different versions of kernels - except the diff ;)
Why did you move to 2.4? Did it justify all the work?

It really wasn't that much work.  Figuring it out how to do it was the 
hardest part.  The main reason I went to the latest and greatest kernel 
is for the latest disk-on-chip drivers which are a standard part of the 
2.4 kernel.  I'm also more familiar with building and working with 2.4 
kernels.

Hi,

	I've been using peewee for a while now, and I'm very happy with it. I tried
several embedded linux distros, and I found peewee the best. So thanks Adi.

	However peewee hasn't been maintained for a while now, so I'm wondering if
there is a project roadmap, what's the status, etc..

	Can you give some pointers Adi ?

thanks

I think the scripts work pretty well as they are know, but an upgrading of
the latest kernel and packages would be a good thing.  It doesn't have to
fall on Adi's shoulders, if we split up rebuilding the packages among a
group of people it could get done pretty quickly.

I'd also like to look at it including a special set of packages with a
minimal X server that works with National Geode chipset SBCs.

yes, I agree completely, if we split the work it would be easier. I think
the changes needed would be just to keep it current.

However, if you search the list, you will see that is rewriting the all
thing.

As he hasn't release anything yet we can't help him there, and working on
the current version could be pointless, depending on his work.

Care to coment Adi ? Anyone ?

Hi,

You're asking a difficult question. I have a list of things I'd like to do 
with PeeWeeLinux. Perhaps the most significant is to build a dedicated 
build environment that one chroots into for building PeeWeeLinux binaries. 
This would be part of the source distribution. The idea is to make 
PeeWeeLinux independent of the underlying Linux distribution and version.
Now the binaries were linked against the existing system libraries, then 
the binaries will be linked against PeeWeeLinux libraries.

Beyond that, I think 2.4.x kernal is need in addition to what's there and 
some of the binaries need to be updated. With the above environment and 
proper scripting it should be pretty easy to rebuild all of the 
PeeWeeLinux packages automatically. A big improvement when it comes to 
updating libraries. That might even allow for a PeeWeeLinuxLite version, 
linked against ulibc...

Right now my problem is time. I mentioned the above before and hoped long 
time ago to have time to work on PeeWeeLinux again. My job has not brought 
any new embedded Linux projects as I hoped, instead im very busy building 
a satellite network. What little time I have left is mostly spend with 
family. What I need is a couple of weeks or so of uncommited evenings to 
get the basics of the ground. I am now hoping for that break to come 
shortly after Christmas, all the things that keep me busy now should be 
wrapped up then.

I open to input, if anyone wants to contribute and make these things 
happen, I'd love to assist in any way I can to get things integrated 
smoothly and take PeeWeeLinux to the next level.

Adi

Not much has happened beyond me explaining my ideas and vision of what it 
could be. Everything is wide open and the latest release is the most 
recent. I have manually build a development environment and made notes of 
what I had to do to prove that it can be done. No scripts yet that would 
integrate anything into PeeWeeLinux, though.

Hello,
I've used PWL to initially create our embedded system. Because it wasn't
updated though, I made my own custom scripts with updated kernel, libraries,
etc, and built an install for my purposes.

I don't have much freetime either, but would be happy to contribute what i
can to the advancement of PWL. If someone wants to take the lead, and
organize the necessary changes, please let me know how i can help.

I don't know much about the sourceforge system that peeweelinux is hosted
on, but might that be a way of getting some of these efforts coordinated?

Hi all,
Is there an easy way to get an uncompressed kernel output (vmlinux or zImage)

I am running an IBM Netvista 2200 Thin Client which runs a Geode processor. 
Apparently, it cannot boot from bzImage.

It appears as if you don't have the init program installed. 

go to your project_folder/mnt/ folder and look to see if the init program is there. It is probably in mnt/sbin/init. 

For some reason your config might not include init (although I can't imagine how..)

I got this error when I was trying to use an old version of LILO 
(patched with mtd) on a 2.4 kernel.  If you're working with the latest 
2.4 kernels, use the latest version of LILO. (which has built-in 
disk-on-chip support)

It appears as if you don't have the init program installed.

go to your project_folder/mnt/ folder and look to see if the init program is
there. It is probably in mnt/sbin/init.

For some reason your config might not include init (although I can't imagine
how..)

I am having the same problem with RH7.3 too!
I have attahced a 32Mb Compact Flash card as hdb and I couldn't
boot from the hda, which is my primary hardrive. However win2k
works fine with the CF in the same config.

If anyone has a solution for that, will be greatly appreciated :)

Hi,

I'm interested in using CF with PeeWee in a car MP3 PC project.  I was
thinking of using CF for the linux distribution so boot up would be quicker.

How fast is CF when booting up? Would it be quicker than a hard drive?

I would still have a hard drive in the system for MP3 storage, should I just
boot up from this and leave CF alone?

When people are talking about small linux distribution of PeeWee how small can
I get it?  I need to have MySQL and Perl installed - is this realistic in a
128MB card for example?

Many thanks in advance,
Paul Nuzzo

CF works great for things like that. ON our embedded system, linux boots on
about 30 seconds. We store an image on the CF and load a ramdisk to run the
system. That way, if the power ever goes out, or the system gets turned of,
the image is not corrupted, and can be rebooted without any system
corruption.

With a little work, I trimmed down linux to under 3MB. With a LOT of work,
you should be able to get a system in under 1.44 MB, although for me, it was
useless...as it had nothing but the kernel.

good luck

OK, I got it to work.  Here's how:

1. I ran ./pwlconfig to create and extract a linux filesystem onto a CF card on my SanDisk SDDR-75 CF reader (I chose the target configuration option which extracts the whole file system)
2. Then I took the config file from peeweelinux "kernelbuild/usr/src/linux/config" directory which I copied to /usr/src/linux-2.4  on my Desktop (I am using RH7.3) 
3. I then ran make xconfig, loaded the config file from step 2, added spcefic changes for my processor (NS Geode 233MHz, which uses the x586 processor type)
4. Then ran make clean, make dep and make bzImage
5. I then copied the created "vmlinux" file onto the CF card. Also copiled /lib/modules/2.4.18.x directory to the CF card (/mnt/flash/lib/modules/2.4.18.x)
6. Then configured the built-in boot loader via the BIOS on my Netvista Thin Client to use the vmlinux file (the boot loader is built into the flash of this machine and lilo will not work)
7. Installed the CF card into the CF slot of the Thin Client, and voila - it worked! (I had to make minor changes to /etc/inittab.)

(Note: I had problems when I tried to buid the kernel from the peeweelinux/kernelbuild/usr/src/linux directory. It compiled, but complained at the end and did not create the kernel images. This is why I decided to build the kernel under the RH7.3 Desktop /usr/src/linux-2.4 directory)

Surprisingly, the kernel 2.4.18.x seems to run OK (so far) with the 2.2.x peeweelinux-created filesystem on the CF card. 

Cheers,
C Nagappa

if you don't use the ramdisk method you can get it to boot much quicker,
which apparently is what the original poster wanted.
