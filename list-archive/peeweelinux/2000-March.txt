Hi,

Just uploading embedded-0.20pre-src.tar.gz and
embedded-0.20pre-bin.tar.gz. It's work in progress. Some added packages,
thttpd and dhcpcd. Also the source packages are now extracted, patched and
compiled. Essentially in the near future it should be possible to create a
PeeWeeLinux distribution from sources and RedHat 6.1 rpms automatically.

Things still unfinished:
- Fixing the boa package. The config file is buggy.
- Replacing the minimal /etc/termcap with a more suitable version.
- Fix all the things that broke by recompiling the packages.
- There no getty in this pre version. Need to fix that, too!

TTYL,
Adi

Hi,

PeeWeeLinux v0.20 is now available. The biggest changes from 0.19 are the
patch files to turn sources into PWL packages. As a result the source
distribution is now less than half the size.

Added thttpd a single threaded webserver with htaccess style
authentication and cgi capabilities.

Added dhcpcd a dhcp client dor situations where pump fails to work
properly.

Hi Ralph,

Just making notes of some random PeeWeeLinux ideas. Thought I'd email them
to you to see what you think...

I cc'd this to the PeeWeeLinux lists. Perhaps someone else using PWL has
ideas or suggestions, too?

Package Names
-------------

Currently packages are named like thttpd-1.2.3.tar indicating the name and
version of the software. This naming applies to all packages build from
original sources regardless of whether they came from the original author
or were taken from a SRPM.

Currently packages build from precompiled binaries (RedHat rpm or running
system) are named thttpd-1.2.3-rh.tar to indicate the fact they were not
compiled and taken from the system. Perhaps still stripped and dependency
checked and associated scripts changed, but no other changes.

Would it make sense to start adding a version numer similar to what RedHat
does? Like creating thttpd-1.2.3-1.tar for the initial release. When a
package is changed due to bugfixes, etc, the version number of the package
could be incremented like thttpd-1.2.3-2.tar. Obviously this wouldn't
happen with every PeeWeeLinux release but as bugs are reported and fixed
or as other features are added.

File List
---------

If you look at the Embedded_Build directory, there is a file called
Filelist (I think) which contains the package names and files associated
with it. Would it make sense to keep a file like it, indicating the
included package name and the related files?

As one of the todo tasks I want to eliminate duplicate files in packages.
Since networking is an obvious feature of Linux I will change the
arrangements of packages in a way that it assumed that networking is going
to be installed. I want to remove all the configuration files from the
base_filesystem and base_libs packages and create a base_script or
base_configuration package that contains all those. Things to include
there would be:

/etc/services
/etc/protocols
/etc/nsswitch

Subsequently I am removing those files from their duplicate places...

Should the Filelist file include the descriptions entered in the
package.README files? I tend to not to include them to not clutter up the
filelist file.

Maintaining the filelist file would make it easy to chack for duplicate
files within the PWL distribution and to enable on to quickly find a
particular binary, i.e. which package includes 'su'?

Distributing PWL
----------------

I am thinking about creating a PWL packages directory on the server in
which to keep all the packages for individual download. Perhaps gzip the
packages, though. This would allow for individual packages to be
downloaded rather than the complete archive if some packages are added.
Also, it would allow for newly build packages to be made available
immediately without having to wait for a new release.

I am a bit torn between the idea of creating a new release too often or
not often enough. Just adding a couple of packes doesn't necessarily
justify creating a new release, especially if some known bugs haven't been
addressed. On the other hand I don't want to not release new features and
additions because I won't have time to address some issues immediately. I
need some guidance here.

Closing
-------

This all comes to mind because I will have a crude X package compiled from
sources soon. This will add some 40MB to the source distribution. I think
it's a bit of a waste to have to download a 50MB file for some minor
changes... I guess there's always the binary distribution.

TTYL,
Adi

Sounds great, then maybe you could also just download a patch file to 
go from xxx-1.2.3-1 to xxx-1.2.3-2 (but these are binaries hmmm...not
sure about that)

Hey, I did this as part of my pwl_update script. I go through the entire
packages directory and list every file into one file .root.list or 
something like that.  Very handy to help speed up the searching for 
a specific file...

Great! Thats one problem I'm having...trying to find a package for a file
and finding it in multiple places.  Also, the extraction continues to 
give errors when a file is duplicated...

Since pwl_config builds and maintains a list for "internal" use, you 
could put most anything here that would make it easy for people to use.
This could be rather time consuming to maintain, but any information
like this would be unique to Pee Wee Linux (I can't find docs for most 
of the other small Linux file systems :-(

BTW, A handy program I just started using, "uniq" will print a list of 
duplicates or a unique list from a file. For example:

cat filelist_A filelist_B | sort | uniq -d   

will list only the files that are duplicated in both lists.

I think this problem is now being solved on some lists with CVS.  You
can check any one latest file or just give an update command to get
all the changes since your last update.  Or you can checkout all files
up to some version number.  Haven't been able to try this yet myself...

Ouch!  I think if the patch files aren't too hard to create, I'd love to 
just load the source from my Red Hat disk and do the patch.  Now my source
matches yours and I didn't need a big download.  Of course, you could
just order the Pee Wee Linux distro CD which has it all :-)

More thoughts...

I've been thinking about all the dozens of little linux's out there and
how we could take advantage of all the work done for them. (Granted, most
are for different kernels, but that may be only a temporary problem).

What if:

Embedded_Build\packages        contains directories:
   PeeWeeLinux
   LinuxRouterProject
   LEM
   Toms_linux
   tiny_linux
   embedded_linux
   mobile_linux
   ...

One of the configuration options for a project would be to select the
distribution you preferr.  pwl_config could only work within that
distribution directory and you could try out different distributions.
Or you could pick and choose some files from various distros...

Of course, now the sources directory just went deeper too.
Maybe something to thinkabout down the road...


Later,
Ralph

Nope, won't work with binary files...

So I wasn't the first to think of it :) Good stuff.

And it's confusing to extract thesame file multiple times.

I just don't want to 'overkill'. Since the README files are already there
there might not be a need to duplicate the info, especially if the package
info is there while using pwlconfig.

I was thinking of creating the filelist using a script.

I am not sure if CVS is really necessary. What about having an
uncompressed PeeWeeLinux tree (contents of Embedded_Build) on the server
and using rsync to synchronize the local copy with the remote copy. That
should be pretty painless and easy. I could even do a script that does
that :) So to upgrade your Embedded_Build directory just run an rsync
job...

Burning a PeeWeeLinux distro CD is no problem. Get to put my CD burner to
good use ;-)  Actually, maybe I could send the sourceforge people a CD
everytime...?

I had a difficult time getting X to run on the ipix. So I choose to
download the latest and compile from scratch. I did the download prior to
thinking about the tar.gz files from the RedHat SRPMS.

Still need to find a way to extract the tar.gz file only from a source
rpm. Then we could add a step to the package build process...

- Extract blah.tar.gz frpm blah.src.rpm
- Extract blah.tar.gz
- Apply blah.patch
- Run ./build_pwl/blah/build_pwl.sh
- Voila, we have a new package

Without the first step I need to include the sources for everything
deviating from the precompiled RedHat binaries.

Every little distro is different. The LinuxRouterProject is very different
in how the packages work. So that's why I started PWL. There wasn't
anything to fit my need. The other big complained. Barely any docs with
any of the other little distros. Someone ought to slap me though. I am not
any better. So far docs aren't much further than your pwlconfig info and
my promises....

Sooo... thinking about the rsync... I think that would be neat... Saved a
lot of bandwith!

So the next release of PWL could be an iso image, a cd... Anything you can
think of :)

TTYL,
Adi

       changed /usr and /local symlinks to a real directory
     o Added base_filesystem-minimal-1.tar for memory constrained systems
     o Added the syslinux-1.48.zip containing syslinux for DOS
     o Revised several packages to support the XFree86 packages
     o Continued work on eliminating duplicate files across packages
     o Adding revision numbers to packages, i.e. thttp-1.2.3-1.tar
                This is the first revision of the package ---^
     o Renamed packages/base/<packages>

       base_configuration
     o Compiled and added XFree86 packages

Enjoy!

Hi,

The disk images I create weren't meant to be upadated remotely. I am
working on a design of the wireless system that stores configuration files
in a compressed file on disk or flash. The settings are loaded when the
system boots and can be saved on demand to make permanent changes.

I've attempted that with PeeWeeLinux 0.20 but quickly ran out of disk
space on the single floppy. PeeWeeLinuc now includes tinylogin, etc.
Hopefully this will make enough room for this feature to be workable.

An alternative would be to use IDE flash or Compacft Flash with IDE
adaptor instead of a floppy.

I'll try to remember to post the wireless stuff to the list when I am
done, now that I know that it's actually being used :)

TTYL,
Adi

IIRC...without java and every feature must be downloaded as a
plug-in...hmmm...might take more RAM...

If you have a fixed set of pages (Kiosk or the like) and don't mind the price
this would be great - from what I've read this is not ready for a prime time,
generic browser. Netscape works...ummm...most of the time :-)

Also, 10Mb of CF is about $40 now (i.e. 32MB $99; 40MB is $139 - single unit,
retail pricing)...3 months from now I expect CF to be less than that; I don't
think they will lower their price on the browser as fast as CF goes down in
price.

So...buy the browser for $35 or pay for the flash...I recommend going for the
hardware, we can always replace the browser later...you're mileage may vary.

However, if you have a Opera Browser package (demo) working I'd love to give it
a try!

Thanks,
Ralph

I found some info on this at:

http://www.rtcgroup.com/elinuxexpo/

Looks like a great, one-day event tied with the RTC people.  No list of
exhibitors...cheapest way would be to share a booth - anyone else going :-)

Date set is for June 22, 2000...wow, 3 months - ummm, not much time...

Also note, for those northerners, eh!

"A second ELEC event is planned for Toronto, Ontario in November 2000."

Hi Ralph,

	They are calling for papers.

http://www.linuxdevices.com/cgi-bin/news_view.cgi?
newsid=NS5955539713&last=&searchcat=&searchkey=

	I think you must send a message to linuxdevices.com just to promote PeeWee.
Or write an article to LinuxJornal.
	They have a column (Embeddeb Systems News Briefs)in LinuxJornal.
	By the way what's peewee ? A chinese city ?
	Cheers,
		Marcio Montenegro
