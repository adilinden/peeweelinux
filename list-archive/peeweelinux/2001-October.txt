Is it possible to make PeeWeeLinux boot into a XWindows without having to
make the user login?  All I need is the user to be able to interact with my
graphical XWindows based program on a touch screen computer.

Thank You,
David Aitken.

On mine, I created a shell script file:
   /etc/rcS.d/95local

to be the last thing run at boot time (so, the '95' is higher than any
other file in rcS.d), containing as the final entry:

  #!/bin/bash
  echo starting X as root
  su - root -c /root/my.autostart &

Then, in the file /root/my.autostart:

  #! /bin/bash
  # Source /etc/profile since don't seem to automatically be getting the PATH
  source /etc/profile
  # /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc has the startup for X and my program
  startx

Where /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc launches the program I want to take over
the screen as well as the window manager.

I wouldn't be surprised if there's an easier way (like just running
'startx' on the su line).  I did this a year or so ago and haven't
changed it since.  I do mine as root, but you may not have to.

Good luck,
Terri

Hi,

I have no experience with CF yet, but I want to get started. Are the
problems
with the CF-IDE adapters due to people hot-swapping them? What if I *only*
insert or remove the CF when the power is off? Am I still likely to have
problems? Is this what others have done, or are you inserting/removing when 
the power is applied?

Many thanks,
steve

The IDE interface does not look like it would support hot swap. Each
IDE device must be reset and configured before it can be used.  Not
normally done except at power-up.

The CF will not be harmed if plugged in hot - the ground pins on the
CF connector are longer and make connection first.

If you leave it installed, it works great - and it should always be
the cheapest flash available.

Good luck,
Ralph

1.My kernel should support the RAMDISK?
2.what is the user and passward of user login? How to

in the tinylogin.

Message-ID: <200110291144.f9TBi0922655@gizmo.adis.on.ca>

I am starting to use Linux embedded software. I downloaded the PeeWeeLinux 
and I am trying to use it. 

I read in the documentation that I can Load the file system only to a 
Disk-On-Chip, but unfortunatelly I do not have one. 

Is there anyway to load the file system to a Floppy disk? 

I think I can do that by reading the Bootdisk-howto, but if anyone has some 
experience on this issue, please, let me know. 

Best regards, 

Lourenço.

I'm trying to use a Mandrake 2.4.8 kernel-source package with PeeWeeLinux. I
copied the rpm to Embedded_Build/RPMS. It shows up in the list of available
kernels but when I try to extract the source files for the kernel the following
error is flashed on the screen before it goes back to the regular blue PWL
screen:

ln: creating symbolic link '/tmp/Embedded_Build/kernelbuild/usr/src/linux/' to
'/tmp/Embedded_Build/kernelbuild/usr/src/linux-2.4.8-26mdk': No such file or
directory

Do I need to do something other than putting my kernel RPM in
Embedded_Build/RPMS?

The documantation is pretty outdated. You can load the image onto a 
floppy, or an attached drive. Just keep in mind that the install process 
will take over the entire drive and replace it's content with your 
embedded system.

run peewee,until appear the interface of "select a
config",then you select one config,then you will find
"make menuconfig",now you open other terminal,delete
the /Embedded_Build/kernel/usr/src/linux,under the
directory of src,tar -zxvf linux-2.4.8.tar.gz(you
should have linux-2.4.8.tar.gz),ok,you back to the old
terminal--peewee interface,now you perform "make
menuconfig",you will find that you are configing the
kernel 2.4.8.I config kernel 2.2.5 with this way is
ok.
