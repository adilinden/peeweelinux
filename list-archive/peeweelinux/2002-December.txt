CF is not as fast as a hard drive, from what I can find.  Especially
on writes, which may not matter here.   One thing peewee does in
this configuration (compressed ramdisk on memory card) on startup 
is to copy the filesystem into RAM, which can take a few seconds.

It ought to be enough.  Peewee is very small, so the question
becomes, "how big is MySQL + perl ?"  I'd like to know
that myself for future planning.

We're using disk-on-chip which is significantly faster than a hard 
driver for both reading and writing. (At least from what I've seen)  I 
would think that CF would be just as fast, but I'm no expert on these 
matters.

Our testing shows that MySQL is roughly 10 megs for a base install 
(binary and empty database).  I'm not sure about perl. (we did java and 
that was another 5 megs after we trimmed down the JVM)  Ultimately we 
chose not do use MySQL because of licensing issues.  By the way, we're 
running on a 64 meg disk-on-chip and had postgres, the JVM, ppp, the 
latest kernel and a decent set of utilities running with room to spare.

Disk on chip and CF are generally slower than hard disk. Disk on chip is probably slower because it uses a 8 bit data bus over ISA which is very slow. CF uses the generic ATA interface and is therefore 16 bit data I beleive. In my experience flash is slower than hard disk, especially writes, which is not relaly a problem with PeeWee since you are not interested in writing data to the drive at run time, typically (I.e.. you are using RAM Disk). If you find yourself using the disk for writes, you might want to use a hard drive.

We're using J9 from IBM. (Websphere Micro Environment)  The first thing 
I did was remove all the source code.  Next, I removed all the class 
files for the profiles we were not using.  (We are using the Foundation 
profile, J9 also includes a CDC, CDLC and MIDP profile)  Then I went 
into the bin directory and figured out what libraries I needed.  I only 
included the libraries necessary for runtime, I removed all compile 
libraries.  Using this method I was able to trim J9 from about 30 megs 
down to about 5.

J9 is J2ME based correct? We have been trying to find a small J2SE. J9
is very fast and efficient; however, Sun will not recognize it as Java
since IBM has not run the compatibility test kit.

hello,
it's the first time I give a try to peeweelinux and I hope I won't ask things that have already been answered...
I downloaded the source package and ran the script pwlconfig. Worked fine until the Extract File System for project. I found out about an hour later I had to run the rpm2tar first. Maybe this will help some new comers like me...
Now for my problem: 
I'm trying to boot on a floppy. I get a "sh: PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin: No such file or directory"
I extracted the ramdisk from the floppy mounted it and ran the script rc.init with a chroot. So I could conclude it comes from the rc.init (boy that's only the second line of the script :( ).
and btw, I'm using busybox (<--- it's probably his fault!!)
Has anybody gone through that?

I use the following for GTK+ static compiles and it appears to work.

hmi:$(HMI_FILE).c $(MCON_SRC)/hmi/sys_hmi.o
	$(CC) -static $(HMI_FLAGS)  -o $@ $(HMI_FILE).c  $(MCON_SRC)/hmi/sys_hmi.o `gtk-config --libs --cflags`

Of course, yours might be a bit simpler (I am linking to a precompiled object file called sys_hmi.o), but you get the idea. My files end up being about 3MB or so. Perhaps the -static option must come first??

I think I saw this complaint from someone else recently.  Normally
this will happen automatically.  In my notes I see the following
observation:

The first time I ran pwlconfig I was taken to:

"Create new project".  After choosing a name I got:

	No tar packages were found. Do you wish to extraxt 
	 all binary rpms and create tar packages now
	 (recommended)?


I can only guess that the pwlconfig script somehow "knows" if
the packages are missing (by looking at some directory) and
something you did fooled it.  The scripts are sometimes
easy to confuse.   Fortunately you found the workaround
and now it's on record.   (This is a long way of 
saying, "it worked for me").

My notes agree with yours (contents of rc.init and so on).  My 
interpretation of your error is that "PATH" is not a program
nor is it a shell command.  To which you say, "of course
not, it's setting an environment variable!"   Yes, but the
shell (?) does not know that, apparently.  Somehow the shell 
is wrong, broken, or not a shell. 

My experience has been that sometimes I start over making
the project, so I can document it and get help, and that
time it works.  It's worth a try.  There are some subtle
things in pwl (and lots of choices to make on the menus)

1. Could it be that the application is already static?
   (Compile without -static and check the size).

2. There is also a -s switch that removes all symbol
table information (strip?); though you can't debug it, 
it gets even smaller.

How about using the "file" program to check? :-)

Subject: [Peeweelinux] compact flash
Message-ID: <000001c2a5e0$e62ab0d0$bbfe0dd5@ricardo>

hi,

	I have 2 compact flash disks that are exactly the same.

	With one of them, when I write a peeweelinux image, it boots fine. with the
other, it doesn't. So I figured the disk was broken, but I tried to "diff"
the contents of both disks, and they were not the same.

	However, I tried to dd the contents of the good disk to a file, and then to
the "broken" disk, and it started working fine.

	I used to think that the peewee scripts wiped everything in the disk, but
now I'm not so sure anymore. Do you have any idea of what could be going on
?

	I'm using peewee under rh8.0.

Thanks
Ricardo Trindade

Yes, pwlconfig will fdisk and format the device. However, I have had cases 
where devices didn't get fdisked properly. That is usually the case when 
fdisk can't determine (or wrongly determines) the disk geometry.
Run fdisk -l on both CF Cards and compare the output.

If that was the case shouldn't a error message appear ? it says it fdisks
and formats the disk fine, it just doesn't boot afterwards, breaks on
mounting the root filesystem.

If it gets the geometry wrong, it will fdisk, format and build the 
filesystem just fine, the files are there but the thing won't boot.

The thing is, everything appears normal until you look at the fdisk -l 
output and it differs from what it should be. unfortunately there are no 
errors generated that would indicate anything is wrong.

I've ran into this problem with Kingston made cards. Sandisk doesn't seem 
to have this problem, at least it never occured when I used Sandisk cards.

I have ahd problems with a Kingston card on a certain machine, but this was for FAT32 stuff (not related to PeeWee .. it was a CNC machine with win95..). The same card worked great with PeeWee on a different machine. It appeares almost as if some machines are more particular about the flash cards, possibly the BIOS??

Well, my bios does not recognize, correctly, the geometry of my compact
flash card (hitachi)

I need to pass the correct values to the kernel when run lilo.
the configuration file:
--
disk=/dev/hd?
bios=0x80
sectors=32
heads=6
cylinders=306
--
This values are common to most 30MB compact flash.
Just update the values of  CHS to the compact flash

Hi friends

I am using PQI 128MB compact flash, to install Peewee with X on it to =
use with QT/X11 application.

=20

It seems to me very interesting, previously I have managed to put Linux =
(montavista) with networking support on my CF .

=20

I want to try it with X now and also peewee Linux with it.

=20

=20

1)     I connect the CF as a secondary master IDE

2)     Do Cfdisk /dev/hdc  to make primary ex2 partition and make it =
bootable which is /dev/hdc1

3)     Reboot=20

4)     Start ./pwlconfig

5)     Configure kernel 2.4.17 and all other packages

6)     When I try to write the thing on my target , which I spacidied as =
/dev/hdc1 in target configuration, it come up with this error L

=20

I tried many times even to format CF again and again (which is not good =
L )

=20

=20

Warning: start=3D32 - this looks like a partition rather than the entire =
disk. Using fdisk on it is probably meaning less [using the -force =
option if you really want this]

=20

Failed

=20

Creating ext2 file system.. mke2fs 1.26

=20

=20

Cannot stat /dev/hdc11 ...... and every thing after this is failed=20

=20

=20

I appreciate any suggestions and help I am new to peewee.

Please help

You don't have to. The pwconfig does it for you.

The target must be a device, not a partition. You have to poit to 
/dev/hdc not hdc1
That should do the trick.

[]s and good luck from Brazil.

P.S. Today it's our first day of summer and it's rainning dogs ;)

peewee creates the partitions based on the size of your image. you can also
specify how much space you want free.

so you should define your target as the device, and not the partition.
partiotions you have previously will be deleted. if you need to add extra
software that is not part of the peewee image you can do that afterwards.

  Hi friends

  I am using PQI 128MB compact flash, to install Peewee with X on it to use
with QT/X11 application.



  It seems to me very interesting, previously I have managed to put Linux
(montavista) with networking support on my CF .



  I want to try it with X now and also peewee Linux with it.





  1)     I connect the CF as a secondary master IDE

  2)     Do Cfdisk /dev/hdc  to make primary ex2 partition and make it
bootable which is /dev/hdc1

  3)     Reboot

  4)     Start ./pwlconfig

  5)     Configure kernel 2.4.17 and all other packages

  6)     When I try to write the thing on my target , which I spacidied as
/dev/hdc1 in target configuration, it come up with this error L



  I tried many times even to format CF again and again (which is not good
L )





  Warning: start=32 - this looks like a partition rather than the entire
disk. Using fdisk on it is probably meaning less [using the -force option if
you really want this]



  Failed



  Creating ext2 file system.. mke2fs 1.26





  Cannot stat /dev/hdc11 .................. and every thing after this is
failed







  I appreciate any suggestions and help I am new to peewee.





  Please help





  Regards



  Rushi

Is there a particular incantation to use the PQI reader / writer?
When I plug the device into my USB bus the kernel sees it but then
complains about no media in the device despite the fact that there is.

This is RH 7.2

It is like the kernel is not looking at all the slots on the device for
media.

Thanks,
Marc

Hi all, I got it running now,
on PQI 128MB flash card, I am using IDE to flash adopter :),

Really peewee is good concept.

What I have done is ,
1) removed every partition from the disk
2) so its just /dev/hdc device
and I make sure every thing is unmounted from the system, as I am using
mandrake 8 which mount every thing(even windows partition) automatically


and just port the things to /dev/hdc

and its working I can see Linux logo at boot , so fb is also on.

now can any one tell me how I can run Xwindowns on it.

I already have /usr/X11R6 in it and XFree86_SVGA server.

I don't have /etc/X11/XFreeconfig :(

as I need to use QT/X11 application with QT libraries on this system.



Also I can not understand the options related to applications in the file
system configuration in pwlconfig.

my application is a binary file which is using some shared QT libraries.


any suggestions .

Thanks for every thing

to add your app you can use the "custom files" option, but that depends on
your setup. on my case I just create the OS, and then manually copy the app
to the card, since I have several apps, which are all diferent, and just the
OS+java+X is the same.

for X, if you have a geode, I can send you a config file, if not, generate a
XF86Config file in your desktop and then copy it to the peewee.

I'm working through the example to create an image to a boot floppy. Instead,
I'd like to write it to my USB disk, so I can move it to my test machine and
see if it boots. Is this possible?

It's possible if the test machine will boot a USB drive.

Basically you have to choose a creating method and then 
specify the USB drive in place of the floppy or hard
drive.  The floppy setup has "/dev/fd0" as the device
to write to, while hard drive options specify "/dev/hdc"
or equivalent.  Your USB drive is likely mapped to a 
scsi device so it would be something like "/dev/sda"
instead.  Be very sure what you specify since the 
script will erase/partition/makefs whatever you
specify.

If the USB drive boots like a floppy then use the
floppy setup; otherwise use one of the hard drive
options to program it.

I don't understand all the options in that disk-creation
script, but I have messed with some of them so give it
a try and let us know what the result is.

Ok, I got a little farther. I just had to make sure that the disk was not 
mounted before
I did "Load File System on Target". I specified /dev/sda for Target Device and
Boot Device on Target System options.

I get these errors whether I write the image to a floppy or usb drive:
Building ld.so.cache...ldconfig: Can't stat /lib: No such file or directory
Can't open configuration file /etc/ld.so.conf: No such file or directory
Can't open directory /usr/X11R6/lib: No such file or directory
Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache: No such file or directory

Any ideas what causes this?

I don't have my system running right now to verify this, but I think
that I see this message a lot when I generate a system.  That file
assists the kernel in finding the library file when a program 
is run.  I don't think it is necessary, it just takes more
time to load a program.  And all the statically linked 
programs don't use libraries at all.

In other words, give it a try and see if it works anyway.

I've gotten this one a bunch, usually when pwl can't write to the target 
for some reason. A couple of checks to run before you try more:

1). If you're running redhat 7 or 8, make sure you run the compatibility 
script, and change your makefiles as described in the pee wee archives 
(which you should know about anyways).
2). You should check to make sure, just regularly, that the system can 
read and write to the usb drive. I've used "usbview", which you can get 
from freshmeat.com, with good success for this sort of hardware scoping. 
You can also look in /proc/bus/ for more info.

Incidentally, could you tell us a little more about your system?

I'm running RH 7.3, so I'll look into the compatibility script you 
mentioned. I've not
done anything in that regard.

As background to what I'm doing, I'm playing with building a dedicated 
Linux-based
MP3 player. I'm developing on an HP laptop with RH 7.3. The box I'm 
developing for
is a EPIA Mini-ITX. It seemed like an easy way to build images and try them out
would be to write to a USB device and then boot from USB.  So my first attempt
was just getting the OS on a USB HDD from the laptop. That seems like it 
will be
no problem. But the Mini-ITX only supports booting off a USB FDD. So I've 
ordered a
Netac Dual-Bootable OnlyDisk that can switch to appear as a FDD. So my plan
is to build the image on the laptop to the USB drive and then plug it into 
the Mini-ITX
and test. Seems like it should work :)

In the meantime, I'm getting acquainted with PeeWee Linux. It's a
great tool for someone who knows next to nothing about developing embedded
Linux.

It looks like the compatibility issues with RH 7+ are the problem. I would 
also go ahead and build your own 2.2 kernel using pwlconfig and try that 
out. If you still find you're having problems, there's a HOWTO in the 
archives for the 2.4 kernels, but it's a bit more work.
