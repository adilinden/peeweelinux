Subject: Custom patched kernel
Message-ID: <3B1CFE07.49A5E249@Sancese.com>

Sorry if this subject has already come up in the past. I browsed the
archives but could not find it.

I'd like to add a custom kernel to peewee, built from a vanilla 2.2.17
(not 2.2.17-13) and patched with RTAI real-time extensions. I have the
complete (patched) source tree ready, but I don't know where to put it
for PeeWee to recognize it (maybe create a tar.gz or rpm??).

I know, the question is dumb.... :-)
Thanks in advance.

Ciao,
Silvio

P.S. Great work, Adi!

Hi,

I would manually build the kernel and modules and include them as a custom
files.

Hi,

The peeweelinux list address is peeweelinux@adis.on.ca.

It sounds like you're running RedHat7.1. The problem you see is an
incompatability between the lxdialog binary included with PeeWeeLinux and
the libraries installed with RedHat7.1.

The solution to the problem has been posted to the list previously. The
archive is at http://adis.on.ca/archives/

TTYL,
Adi

Subject: low "Low" dos memory error
Message-ID: <20010611173248.73999.qmail@web13504.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,
   Peeweelinux rules!
   After choosing the FAT16 (compressed or
uncompressed) to build the 'minimal' project. SYSLINUX
reports that I don't have enought low dos memory to
continue. 
   I am running a DOC that i had previously
successfully configured to boot with doc-lilo using
the MSYS instructions for a ext2 scheme.

   I tried playing with the free ramdisk section of
the hardware configuration page, but for lack of
expertise I failed miserably :-( . I also looked at
the generated syslinux.cfg , the only number i saw in
the configation was ~11000. I suppose this is
calculated from the freespace requested in pwl_config.
 
  Is this a bios problem?
  Is it possible to use doc-lilo instead of lilo to
configure my DOC?

Well, 
   I was able to get minimal to load after replacing
every execution of lilo in pwl_target_load with
doc-lilo ( from Msys driver ). The doc configuration
took place with no problem , I even saw the penguin.
Great!
   I don't know what was wrong with the SYSLINUX
configuration but I will keep my eyes peeled for an
answer.
   Somebody had mentioned creating a FAQ . While I am
no document writer , I could probably put together
alot of questions with relevant answers from the email
archive. I'd rather not do this without the support of
the list so please respond on this note.

Thanks 
Tim

Hi Tim,

There is defenitely a need for documentation. A FAQ would be a great
start!
