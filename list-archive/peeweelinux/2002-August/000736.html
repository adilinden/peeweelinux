<PRE>&gt;<i>Hi Barry,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Have you seen Troy Engel's &quot;kernel 2.4 mini-howto&quot;? 
</I>
No, but I saw a reference to it.  For some reason I was never able
to locate it.  I had downloaded the archives and imported them to 
my mail reader, so it was a search problem.   Thanks to your link, 
I have it in my sights now.


&gt;<i>Also, for what it's worth, I usually just include my custom kernel (bzImage) 
</I>&gt;<i>as a &quot;custom&quot; file, effectively replacing the one created by Peewee.
</I>
I found that if I save the result of &quot;packaging the kernel&quot; into a
directory of my own naming, it shows up in the package selection
for the project just like the &quot;stock&quot; kernel does.  So far seems
to work.  Sounds similar to what you are doing.  Unless you are
able to manage the sources separately.


&gt;<i>but it does allow me to control the kernel building process independent of 
</I>&gt;<i>Peewee's scripts or compiler dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Mark
</I>
So much of using pwlconfig is tied up in undestanding what it's 
trying to do.   It helps to know how to do it in the first place.
I have a lot better picture of kernel making now that I've done
it by hand a few times.

Thanks for the lead.

Barry
