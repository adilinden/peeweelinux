Hi,

I wanted to initially test Peewee Linux systems on a partition of my regu=
lar PC. It is already set up to boot multiple systems (using Grub in the =
boot partition). I was hoping to simply mount the partition and then copy=
 over the file system produced by the pwlconfig extract command. Is this =
a valid approach? the reason I ask is that it does not seem to work. Hits=
 a couple of errors (e.g., No journal on file system, mount error 22, and=
 finally No init found).

I have started with the wireless-isa example project.

Thanks,

Steve.

Hiya folks, I have a few minor questions re: PWL if someone has a few 
minutes.  We're building the prototype hardware right now, and I've got 
a custom kernel (need >4 serial ports, shared IRQ) built and the PWL 
filesystem onto my CF. yay!

I'm new to embedded/flash stuff, so sorry if this is basic.

1) /dev/sda1 contains the boot files, sda2 contains the OS. there's a 
sda3 partition on the rest of the CF card (128meg card), which I want to 
utilize as my own personal scratch space (this device reads from serial 
ports and stores logfiles for later upload).  Can i just make ext2 on 
/dev/sda3, and mount it in sda3/etc/fstab as hda3?  is it that simple?

sda2/etc/fstab looks like:

/dev/ram0       /               ext2    defaults
/dev/hda2       /mnt/flash      ext2    ro,noauto,defaults
none            /proc           proc    defaults

2) anyone have some quick primers on setting up the dhcpd/pump and ppp 
with this distro?  I'm sure I could noodle around and figure out what to 
put where, but it'd help if someone else had an example. ;)

3) java vm -- anyone gone through the pain and found a good one? (we're 
looking at Waba, I think)

Any other wonderful words of advice would be great, so far I'm cruising 
along with only a few hurdles.  I'm just beginning to get the hang of 
how things work in the embedded space....

oh! with CF media, can I just use dd to dump the entire card to a file, 
so I can duplicate it onto other cards? (ala a normal harddrive, block 
device, etc)

thanks!

3) java vm -- anyone gone through the pain and found a good one?
(we're looking at Waba, I think)

There are 2 versions of Waba for Linux.

One is based on GTK, and the other one is based on PicoGUI
(picogui.sourceforge.net).
PicoGUI version is the one actively updated, like every 2 months or so.

Me? I'm one of the developers (VM hacker ?) for Waba...

I hope this helps.

Sincerely,

Isao F. Yamashita

Hi,

	I'm using peewee on a 128Mb CF and sun's jre 1.3 fits in there. takes
almost half the card, but at least it's a full jvm

Hi Ricardo,

Cool!  Our device is booting (yay!), now it's on to even more fun stuff. 
  Do you have a methodology for installing the jvm, and where do you put 
your code?

I was thinking of formatting and mounting sda3 (rest of CF card) as 
/opt, and putting the JVM and our code over there.  See any downsides to 
that?  Is it too slow to run right off CF, and should I be installing it 
with PeeWee, and having it load into ramdisk?

thx,
-te

Subject: [Peeweelinux] bug in libstdc++ tarball
Message-ID: <3CF7BCFF.7000902@fluid.com>

Hiya all,

I'm going through all the tarballs, replacing the defaults with my own 
stuff, and there's a bug in the supplied libstdc++ (peewee-0.61.1) build:

libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2 -> 
/var/tmp/egcs-1.1.2-root/usr/lib/libstdc++-2-libc6.1-1-2.9.0.so

which, of course, should be just a simple symlink without the (/var/tmp) 
path.
