Message-ID: <398E502B.7616103@pacbell.net>

Did anyone notice that the 0.47 distribution has the libutil.so.*
missing?  I had to copy it from RedHat v6.0 and then force the
package netkit-telnet* to install with the --nodeps option.

Did this get fixed already?

Hi,

You're right, libutil is missing! It was probably lost during the
conversion of the sources to an rpm based build process.

I am just building a new glibc package that will include libutil and will
be part of the next (0.49) PeeWeeLinux release.

Thanks for catching this!

TTYL,
Adi

PeeWeeLinux 0.49 is out. It fixes the missing libutil library in glibc.
Also, the ncurses library has been added as well as some applications that
require ncurses.

Find it here:
    http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=818 
    ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/distributions/peewee/ 

I'll try to eliminate termcap and build all packages relying on termcap to
use ncurses instead.

TTYL,
Adi

Hi,

Sure, you just need to connect the harddrive to the development system.
Then you can use pwlconfig to build the system and load onto the
harddrive. It's a bit awkward if your target machine is not the same. But
for development purposes it works great, if the HD to run PWL is actually
/dev/hda and your development system dualboots from another drive.

TTYL,
Adi

PeeWeeLinux 0.50 is now available. 

I would say it's the first stable release available. It's up on
Sourceforge and I hope the damgaged files on metalab will be fixed soon.

Unfortunately thes are the only docs available at this 
time. There are a number of changes happening to the 
configuration tool when it comes to loading a flash 
system onto the target device. I.e: ramdisks from FAT 
and ext2 will be supported as well as read-only root 
filesystems on the target device.

Some of the new stuff will hopefully be available next 
week some time.

For now I would suggest experimenting with pwlconfig to 
get things going.

TTYL,
Adi
