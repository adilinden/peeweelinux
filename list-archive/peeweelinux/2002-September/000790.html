<PRE>That problem was caused by rpm. I think there were some changes in later 
versions of rpm. The quick fix at the time was to use the specific rpm 
version that was known to work. This is the solution for RedHat 6.x

Having said that, I don't think the RedHat 7.x binary rpms work with 
older rpm versions. Not sure about that, though. Never tried RedHat 7.x 
rpms myself just because of the issues involved with different glibc 
versions.

</I>&gt;<i>   Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>   I am new to pwl and am trying to shrink down an existing RH 7.2 project to
</I>&gt;<i> run on a CF.  I am able to create basic distros on the CF and boot from them
</I>&gt;<i> fine. Problem is I am trying to add apache (apache-1.3.20-16.i386.rpm) and
</I>&gt;<i> others to my project. This is what I have done:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - log in as root
</I>&gt;<i>   - copied the apache rpm file into RPMS directory.
</I>&gt;<i>   - run pwlconfig-&gt;Manage Package Files
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   When I try to extract a binary, I see the rpm in the list and I select it.
</I>&gt;<i> It comes back saying package was extracted. However there are no *.tar or
</I>&gt;<i> *.list files created anywhere for apache.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   When I try to extract ALL binaries, it runs thru them all (including
</I>&gt;<i> apache) and does create a *.tar and *.list file in the Deamons directory,
</I>&gt;<i> but &quot;tar tvf&quot; is empty and the list file is zero size.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   What am I doing wrong?
</I>&gt;<i>   Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>   Bob
