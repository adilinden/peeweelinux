&gt;<i>Hello, Can anyone tell me how to add packages in peewee... For example:

&gt;<i>From what I can ascertain, peewee works from rpm's.  I do know
</I>(because I have notes) that when peewee is first brought up,
it unpacks the rpms from a certain directory, and then builds
tar files which it stores in the packages directory.  I don't
know what happens if you add another rpm, whether it &quot;knows&quot;
and offers to convert it, whether you have to find this
operation on the menu, or whether it's a manual task.  One
of us should try it and find out :)

With packages, Adi cautions us to make sure they come from
the same RH6.2 system that peewee comes from, so that your
program will find the libraries it needs.  Other fiddling
may be required since peewee packages were built with some
unneeded features left out...so the program might not work.

The nice thing is that packages put in this way are automatically
recognized and show up in the menu just like the rest of 'em.

There is another way to include programs and files outright.
By building into directory called &quot;/root/custom&quot; you can
have files just copied into the target system and if there
are no issues with the result then they are ready to go.  This
works for things that don't have many files.   There are menu
options that let you collect and select the custom files. 

Hope this helps somehow.

Barry
