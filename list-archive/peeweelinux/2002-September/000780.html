Yep.


&gt;<i> &gt;In my build script I've tried to include syslog and turn on as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;much logging as possible but may have screwed that up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> syslog is on my to-learn list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;loads the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and gets it to a screen with a bunch of startup and routing (which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;strange because I've not installed any networking either in the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the packages) information but it halts there with no login prompt. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;guessing it's getting to a serial console?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would think it would go to a serial console (1) if you told it to,
</I>&gt;<i> or (2) if it couldn't find the native (?) console.  Since you see
</I>&gt;<i> all those messages it must be that it knows how to talk to the
</I>&gt;<i> native console (an LCD screen?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;if there is any trick to getting regular bootup information viewable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;after a boot I'd sure love to hear about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a line in the scripts that checks for the existence of a
</I>&gt;<i> file /etc/boot.silent and it looks like it would send output to
</I>&gt;<i> /var/log/boot, otherwise the screen...That silent file doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> appear so it should go to the screen.   Of course that is
</I>&gt;<i> for the init scripts that run after the kernel has come up.
</I>&gt;<i> I did put an 'echo &quot;hi world&quot; ' in one of the init scripts and
</I>&gt;<i> it does indeed show up on my screen.    Now that I've looked
</I>&gt;<i> at what it actually does, maybe I should try creating the
</I>&gt;<i> quiet file and see what I get...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which part of the sequence is missing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

The only thing that I have in the /var/log directory is the wtmp file, 
which is empty. This is probably my main problem, without feedback I don't 
really know where to look...


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;2). (Intermediate) The 6100 has a dos 5.x ROM, so I think I have to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;loadlin as my bootloader: when I try to use the FAT 16 / ramdisk setup,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the unit won't seem to recognize the partition as bootable. Has anyone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;used loadlin with pee wee? I looked at the FAT 12 partition that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;script is creating for the booting off of and it looks like something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;similar is going on, but I think the norand hardware needs an
</I>&gt;<i> autoexec.bat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;file in order to get loadlin working.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the beginning I was able to boot my system using loadlin.  What I
</I>&gt;<i> was doing was making a &quot;floppy&quot; (actually writing the fat12 image
</I>&gt;<i> to a hard drive partition).  The resulting syslinux.cfg file has
</I>&gt;<i> all the parameter information you need to construct a loadlin command.
</I>&gt;<i> You put the kernel image and the ramdisk image where you want to
</I>&gt;<i> boot from and those filenames are the ones you use with loadlin.
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't figured out what the other target image generating options
</I>&gt;<i> in peewee do; unfortunately I don't know of any documentation about
</I>&gt;<i> that.  All I can do is select one of the Target image choices, let
</I>&gt;<i> it make it, and then inspect the results on a running system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't usually offer such dubious help, but it's pretty quiet
</I>&gt;<i> here otherwise.  Hope it helps.
</I>
Any little bit, this was much appreciated. I hadn't thought to fool around 
with the syslinux.cfg file, I'll definitely try that out. And if I figure 
out anything about the syslog files I'll definitely pass it on. Thanks 
again,
