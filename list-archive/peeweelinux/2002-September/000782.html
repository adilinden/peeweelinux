<PRE>I am having problems being able to ping my machine.
I have read and re-read some of the previous archives and I still can't get
my 
network card seen on my PeeWee build.

I am using a m-sys DOC 2000 with the MTD kernel support.  I have made
my build image and have put my custom files and apps onto the build.
I am also using kernel 2.4.18.  The system boots fine into my DOC and the 
file system looks fine and my app works except the networking part does not.
I have put my own custom ifcfg-eth0 file into the /etc/config location and
when 
the system boots and I go look at the file it has the correct information in
it, but 
I cannot ping the system from another computer.

Just to let you know I can see the system if I boot from the HD into my
installed
Linux Red Hat 7.3 version with the same ifcfg-eth0 and hosts files I am
trying to use
with PeeWee.  I can ping the system fine when I am booted into this system.

One things that I have done to try to get this to work:
Rebuilt the kernel so that my NIC is embedded into the kernel and not a
module,  but after 
building and placing my bzImage under /boot is there anything else to do.
Shouldn't the system
find the ethernet card and use the config files and initialize my card??

Or what about insmod or modules???

I would appreciate any HELP!!!
