<PRE>&gt;<i>My build environment is a Red Hat 7.2 / 2.4.17 setup with an 
</I>&gt;<i>ISA PCMCIA bridge. 
</I>
Have I got this right?  Your host is RH 7.2  Your target is peewee
with the 6.2 packages, but you have a custom kernel that's 2.4.17


&gt;<i>In my build script I've tried to include syslog and turn on as 
</I>&gt;<i>much logging as possible but may have screwed that up. 
</I>
syslog is on my to-learn list.

&gt;<i>loads the kernel 
</I>&gt;<i>and gets it to a screen with a bunch of startup and routing (which is 
</I>&gt;<i>strange because I've not installed any networking either in the kernel or 
</I>&gt;<i>the packages) information but it halts there with no login prompt. I'm 
</I>&gt;<i>guessing it's getting to a serial console? 
</I>
I would think it would go to a serial console (1) if you told it to,
or (2) if it couldn't find the native (?) console.  Since you see 
all those messages it must be that it knows how to talk to the
native console (an LCD screen?)

&gt;<i>if there is any trick to getting regular bootup information viewable 
</I>&gt;<i>after a boot I'd sure love to hear about it.
</I>
There is a line in the scripts that checks for the existence of a
file /etc/boot.silent and it looks like it would send output to
/var/log/boot, otherwise the screen...That silent file doesn't
appear so it should go to the screen.   Of course that is 
for the init scripts that run after the kernel has come up.
I did put an 'echo &quot;hi world&quot; ' in one of the init scripts and
it does indeed show up on my screen.    Now that I've looked
at what it actually does, maybe I should try creating the
quiet file and see what I get...

Which part of the sequence is missing?


&gt;<i>2). (Intermediate) The 6100 has a dos 5.x ROM, so I think I have to use 
</I>&gt;<i>loadlin as my bootloader: when I try to use the FAT 16 / ramdisk setup, 
</I>&gt;<i>the unit won't seem to recognize the partition as bootable. Has anyone 
</I>&gt;<i>used loadlin with pee wee? I looked at the FAT 12 partition that the 
</I>&gt;<i>script is creating for the booting off of and it looks like something 
</I>&gt;<i>similar is going on, but I think the norand hardware needs an autoexec.bat 
</I>&gt;<i>file in order to get loadlin working.
</I>
In the beginning I was able to boot my system using loadlin.  What I
was doing was making a &quot;floppy&quot; (actually writing the fat12 image
to a hard drive partition).  The resulting syslinux.cfg file has
all the parameter information you need to construct a loadlin command.
You put the kernel image and the ramdisk image where you want to
boot from and those filenames are the ones you use with loadlin.
I haven't figured out what the other target image generating options
in peewee do; unfortunately I don't know of any documentation about 
that.  All I can do is select one of the Target image choices, let 
it make it, and then inspect the results on a running system.

I don't usually offer such dubious help, but it's pretty quiet
here otherwise.  Hope it helps.

Barry
