I have exactly same problem , does any one have any solution ??

did u solve it David ??

Hello,

I'am trying to use the PeeWeeLinux on an embedded platform. I have =3D
downloaded the ISO distribution and make a configuration with PWLCONFIG =
=3D
for my target platform. All the boot and initialisation are OK and i can =
=3D
login and enter the password. But when i tryied to start the W server =
=3D
the next message appear:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
=3D
---------------------------------
execve failed for /usr/X11R6/bin/X    (errno 2)
_X11TransSocketUNIXConnect: can't connect: errno =3D3D 111
giving up
xinit: connection refused (errno 111): unable to connect to X server
xinit: No such process (errno 3): server error
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
=3D
---------------------------------

I don't know what happened, and i would like to know why the X server =
=3D
don't start.
Are there missing some files, packages on my PWLCONFIG configuration ?
Is it a reported bug ?

Would you be so kind to help me on this problem because i would like to =
=3D
use Xfree86. I would like to use a graphic interface to run an =3D
application made with FLTK lib or QT lib.

Best regards

Hi everyone,
Can any one supply any example image with running X on peewee, its been long
time and many hours I am trying to get X with peewee. At last I got X
working but I have to block the mouse for that so it is of no use.

1) I installed peewee with X libs and Xserver
2) I use redhat 7.1 now , I was using Mandrake 8 before
3)I copy some file from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 like keyboard layout and server
policy
4) I copy XF86Config to /etc/X11

what I am getting if I don't bock mouse when running XF86_SVGA has
Can not open mouse(no device found)
Fatel error
than I have blocked  mouse by  AllowMouseOpenFail
and yes I am getting a graphical screen and a cursor in the centre but of no
use as I can not use mouse.
I have spend a hell of time after Xwindows on peewee, if some one can really
help me on this,
I would be appreciate if Adi you can send me some really good information
rather than just suggestions.

please explain step by step in detail that how to configure the X on peewee,
I really need that actually other wise things does not seems working easily
on Linux

Please Help

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Peewee network setup script
Message-ID: <003201c3b299$7a5afe70$0300a8c0@Hiperdata>

Hi everybody:


I'm new in the list, new in Peewee, and new with Linux

I like peewee, I did my first project and work great !!!

But now I need some customization:

I need to  distribute peewee linux in almost 100 computers,
I don't want to build 100 diferent systems, I would like something like
this:
A script with network setup in the same diskette than the user can easily
edit outside peewee,
At boot automaticly mount floppy and run network script, this script must be
out of image and not compressed

How can I do that?

Best regards

P.D. I'm apologize about my english
