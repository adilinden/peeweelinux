Message-ID: <3B493ECC.C32CD028@schu.net>

Hello All,

I am trying to put together a router that runs from a compact flash
card.  Anyway, I could not get the card to boot to linux no matter what
I tried, however I could sys the disk in dos and boot dos.  Anyway I
fdisked the compact flash card trying to make it work and now I can't
get anything to work.  I noticed that there is a warning on the site
about fdisk, but unfortunately I didn't read it until it was to late.  I
still think that the card works because I have a fat16 FS on it now and
I can see it from a dos boot disk just fine, I just can't boot from it. 
Is there anything I can do to fix the problem?  I wonder if a format
command on a digital camera will fix my problem.

thanks

Hi,

Try dos fdisk and dos 'fdisk /mbr' to restor the boot sector.

Adi,

I didn't know that you are the one that put together peeweelinux.  If I
had known I would have bought the cf adapter from you because I like to
support linux.  Anyway.....

I did a fdisk /mbr using a windows 98 boot disk and that seems to work
fine, but when I run fdisk I get error reading fixed disk.  I got this
error before the boot problem but didn't worry about it because it
booted fine.  I can read the disk with partition magic.  I can make a
dos partition and format it.  I can also see the formated disk and copy
data to and from it, but still can't boot.

Any other ideas?  I am thinking about trying syslinux to make it boot.

Also, what is the correct way to put linux on a compact flash anyway? 
Syslinux, with a initrd?

Hi,

On a Linux box I use a USB flash reader to do all the CompactFlash card
manipulations. This worls great whether it be a multi partition Linux
system with ext2 partitions and lilo or a ramdisk based system using
syslinux and a ramdisk image.

I have used the CF-IDE adapter quite successfully for installing syslinux
on a DOS formatted CF card. However, formatting a CF using the CF-IDE
adapter using linux fdisk seems to have its problems.

The trouble is very specific to using fdisk and the CF-IDE adapter. Once
the partitions are done I have never had a problem with the CF-IDE
adapter. I.e. running mke2fs, mkdosfs, lilo, syslinux, etc all works fine.

I have not come across any CF-IDE adapters that are hotswap yet. This is a
big disadvantage when developing. That's another reason I try to stick
with the USB adapter (Sandisk SDDR-31 works well) for loading the CF on
the development system.

If the system is to be ramdisk based I think syslinux and an initrd are
the way to go. 

TTYL,
Adi

Hi Adi,

How about doing development on a laptop and using a PCMCIA-CF adapter, does
fdisk work OK in that configuration?

Cheers,

Bob Blick

Hi Bob,

The PCMCIA-CF adapter seem to work just fine. I worked with one just
briefly and never had any problems.

Subject: Log On problem
Message-ID: <NFBBKEHGOLMKDOLKMPDBIECICAAA.paulr@solutionsplus.com.au>

I am experimenting with PeeWee Linux but have encountered a problem.

I attached a small HD to my development system.  Configured a test
installation using pwlconf (basic kernel with limited network modules
selected).  I loaded the configuration onto the HD (compressed RAM disk on
ext2) and then transferred the HD to my test system.

The system booted up to a login prompt.

When I entered either the admin or root login the system flashed up a
message (something to do with the file system) and then exited back to the
login prompt.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to the cause of this problem and how to get
round it.

Thanks,
 Paul Russell

Subject: Query abot ISO Images
Message-ID: <001b01c11428$2c2b7f20$01010a0a@MSI2K.local>

I would like to use an ISO image onto a CDR to create an ICA client for an
IBM Laptop (390E).

I am a bit concerned that the config program asks for a device to write the
image to and the warning suggests that the existing filesystem on the
selected device will be overwritten.  As I have no spare HD's on this
system, can someone tell me wether this is just an old message as this
option is still experimental and that a ISO image only will be added to the
selected device or will it really clober the device and then produce an ISO
image from the new filesystem




Thanks

Michael

Adi,

I've been following pee-wee Linux for a while now. I think its valuable 
stuff. Are you interested in talking about it at the Embedded Linux Expo 
& Conference, in Boston, in October? Here's a link for the San Jose 
conference from about a month ago. The Boston conference will be similar.
