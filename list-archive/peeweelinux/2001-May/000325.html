<PRE>Hi,

Thank you for sharing the solution you found regarding RedHat 7.0. I
forwarded your email to the PWL list as well for reference.

I am currently spending what little spare time I have left at building a
secure webserver to replace my aging server in place now. Once that has
been accomplished I will be looking at more PeeWeeLinux development.
Unfortunately I am left with very little time these days...

TTYL,
Adi

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, but I found a solution by brute force...  I was looking through
</I>&gt;<i> the RedHat 7 image, and found /usr/bin/kgcc, which is of a different
</I>&gt;<i> size than the normal /usr/bin/gcc.  I replaced gcc with kgcc in the
</I>&gt;<i> Makefile, and the build was successful.  Digging around later on the
</I>&gt;<i> RedHat website I found a &quot;gotcha&quot; entry describing the problem as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;For various reasons, gcc is no longer able to compile the kernel from 
</I>&gt;<i> source because it uses the 2.96 version of the GNU C Compiler. However, 
</I>&gt;<i> it is still easy to compile your kernel, as version 2.91.66 of the egcs 
</I>&gt;<i> C compiler has been included with the distribution&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> that explains kgcc's purpose, although they don't bother to give
</I>&gt;<i> specifics on what changed in gcc 2.96 that broke the kernel build.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for getting back to me anyway, I am really enjoying working
</I>&gt;<i> with the PWL distribution so far.  If I could figure out what I am 
</I>&gt;<i> doing wrong trying to get pump to work properly in my image (works
</I>&gt;<i> fine for dhcp on the RedHat host) I'd be basically done.  I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> it's something minor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if the package included the newer XFree86 4.0.3 build 
</I>&gt;<i> for support of the newer video devices.  Also, I noticed that the ICA 
</I>&gt;<i> client including is an older one, Citrix has a 6.0.908 release, and PWL 
</I>&gt;<i> has 3.00.77 in it.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Haven't came across this yet. Can you send me the kernel config file? That

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am working on building up a very small image using the ISO CD image
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I downloaded yesterday.  It looks pretty good so far, but I do have a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; questions.  I suspect I'm missing something obvious and hopefully you have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seen this before...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First of all, I have been able to get an image installed onto a drive and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; boot the kernel, so the basics seem to be working fine.  I am having
</I>&gt;<i> trouble
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; building a custom kernel, which when done from within pwlconfig reports it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was successful, but I do not get a bzImage file in the custom kernel
</I>&gt;<i> package
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when it completes.  The package (in this case kernel-Target_64-2.2.17)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contains /boot, but no kernel.  I saw from the PeeWee website that
</I>&gt;<i> building
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the kernel from inside the tool is fairly new, so I decided to try it by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hand instead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Building it manually from kernelbuild/usr/src/linux (2.2.17-13) under the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Embedded_Build tree fails on arch/i386/usr/lib/checksum.S.  That is quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; strange, since a diff of it and the same file on the host /usr/src/....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shows they are identical.  It fails on the #define definitions for SRC()
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DST().  The specific error messages are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checksum.S:231: badly punctuated parameter list in #define
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checksum.S:237: badly punctuated parameter list in #define
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, that blows up the kernel build.    I suspect something is wrong
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the build environment, but haven't been able to track it down yet.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; host machine is RedHat 7.0 (2.2.17-8) from Dell.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any hints you might have would be very much appreciated...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
