<PRE>I managed to reproduce an eariler problem I had, which looks
like a problem with ldconfig, but it isn't really.  When I see:

  Editing inittab...failed                                                
  Building ld.so.cache...ldconfig: Can't stat /lib: No such file or direc 
  ldconfig: Can't stat /usr/lib: No such file or directory                
  ldconfig: Can't open configuration file /etc/ld.so.conf: No such file o 
  ldconfig: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: No such  
   
it means I have forgotten to &quot;Extract File System for Project&quot;.  It's 
easy to forget, and pwlconfig doesn't check to see if mnt is empty.

Okay, good FAQ entry.   BUT!  (here's part 2)

I've attempted to add some packages to my system.  Building the
target system says that it _succeeded_, yet in the log, I see:

  .
  .
  Editing inittab...ok 
  Building ld.so.cache...ldconfig: Can't open configuration file /etc/ld.
  /lib:
         libtermcap.so.2 -&gt; libtermcap.so.2.0.8 
         libnss_files.so.2 -&gt; libnss_files-2.1.3.so 
         libcrypt.so.1 -&gt; libcrypt-2.1.3.so 
         libc.so.6 -&gt; libc-2.1.3.so 
         ld-linux.so.2 -&gt; ld-2.1.3.so 
  /usr/lib: 
  ok 
  Unmounting loopback device...ok 
  Compressing /dev/loop0 into ramdisk...3416+0 records in
  3416+0 records out  
  .
  .

Is that one of those &quot;nuisance errors&quot; as in &quot;nothing to do&quot; ?
The target system comes up but I don't know enough about it
yet to know if it's all there.

Other times I get actual failures in that area.  Usually when 
I've modified a project and build it for the first time.  It
fails a few times and then when I come back later it succeeds
without my having changed it.  It seems to be connected with
the setting of some variables, but I haven't been able to 
&quot;trick it&quot; just by quitting pwlconfig and re-entering.  But
I do log out a lot and restart the system frequently, so, I'll \
keep observing.

Barry
