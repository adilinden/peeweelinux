<PRE>In the following messages I will reveal answers to questions 
that might be posed by someone starting out cold.  By the time
I get through this, I'll no longer qualify :)

Getting PeeWee

After going to SourceForge and downloading the binary package,
and untarring it to a suitable directory tree, I discovered
a few things.

   - It looks just like the directory tree on the CD
   - It has one bad symlink to SRPMS
   - There's a script in the top directory called cd_install

Sure enough, the difference between the CD and the binary package
is the presence of the SRPMS.  In the binary package the SRPMS
are removed.  I ran the cd_install script, and (after following
the directions to become root) let it remove what I had untarred
and, near as I can tell, it then copied the same things back
to that directory (plus the sources).

So for first-time obtainers, the images found on SourceForge
are as follows:

old name: embedded-0.18-src.tar.gz
   If you look back through the versions, you will find that the
   name changed between versions 0.32 and 0.40

CD image: peeweelinux-0.61.1.iso
   Burn this to a CD and everything described below is there.

Source package: peeweelinux-0.61.1-src.tar.gz
  Untar this and get the same thing that you see on the CD.
  Includes, source, binary, and configuration.

Binary package: peeweelinux-0.61.1-bin.tar.gz
  Untar this and get the CD image, except the source tree
  from src/SRPMS is not present.

Configuration tool:
  This is just the pwlconfig scripts and utilities found
  in the bin, scripts, and lxdialog directories. 



Corrections are solicited.  

Next: Installing ('Unpack')

After that: Making a system (hint--I need help: I couldn't
  find &quot;boot_system&quot;; and the unmodified &quot;minimal&quot; image
  didn't fit on a floppy.)

See y'all next week.

Barry
