<PRE>Thanks everyone for your wonderful input. I've been digging into PWL and learning 
how things work. I've already managed to configure my embedded system, loaded my 
custom application, and it runs! YEAH!!!!!! (minus a few configuration issues)

With that, and all your suggestions, I'll have this thing flying in no time. In case 
anyone cares, for those doing research, I'm using an Advantech PCM-5820 Biscuit 
board with a CompactFlash disk. Advantech doesn't support linux, but the hardware is 
generic, and so far everything is working great. 

On a side note...before discovering PWL, I attempted to create my own distribution. 
While possible...all i can really say about the experience is AAARRRRGGGHHHHH!!! A 
few more months and I may have had it. PWL saved me tons of time.

A Big Thanks to the creators of PWL!!!!

Thanks again for all your help.

I solved this one by upgrading to kernel 2.4.18 (see my howto in 
previous list archives), and then using ext3 as the filesystem for the 
3rd &quot;leftover&quot; partition as (mounted as /opt on boot).  Here's a small 
script I use that makes/populates /dev/sda3 after PWL rebuilds the flash 
card:

   #!/bin/sh

   echo &quot;Creating filesystem...&quot;
   mke2fs -j -b 1024 -m0 /dev/sda3

   echo &quot;Populating filesystem...&quot;
   mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 /mnt/usbdev
   cp -a /usr/local/pwl/Embedded_Build/opt_tree/* /mnt/usbdev/

   echo &quot;Syncing and unmounting...&quot;
   sync
   umount /mnt/usbdev

So, of course, this requires you keep the &quot;master&quot; /opt tree on your 
build machine.  Couple this ext3 filesystem with a SanDisk industrial 
grade CF disk, and you're set.  I've had nothing but good luck with ext3 
recovers.

&gt;<i> 2. Is there any documentation on how to use the custom features of PeeWeeLinux? I 
</I>
Besides my /opt dealio above, I just make custom .tar files that mimic 
the PWL shipped ones, and throw them right into the mix.  They then show 
up nicely in ./pwlconfig and you can just select them.  See the 2.4.18 
howto, once again, for how I did this. Your mileage may vary. ;)

&gt;<i> 3. In the same regard, certain config files need to be updated during operation of 
</I>
Make them symlinks to the files loaded on /opt (or just copy them over 
from /opt on boot) and you're set.  Of course, make sure /opt is mounted 
before doing anything fun. ;)
