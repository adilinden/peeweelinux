I though someone might say that theirs fits with room to spare and
that it didn't fit until they figured out they had to do such-and-such.
But it looks like that's not the case.   Clearly all of peewee's users
have moved on to bigger media.   As I shall, shortly.

I chose peewee *because* it wasn't trying to fit a floppy.  I looked
at many &quot;embedded&quot; sites and many were no good for me because of this.
I found the following on a website.  It's in a discussion between Ralph
and Adi:
 
  &quot;Also, nobody is targeting the 3MB - 32MB systems.&quot;

So, think &quot;niche&quot;.

&gt;<i>however, you can't do nothing interesting with it. 
</I>
You can do demonstrations like showing that it works, and also to
quickly become familiar with which commands you didn't realize
you couldn't live without :)

BTW I notice that bin has the &quot;real&quot; versions of the programs.  It
might be that a busybox implementation would leave room for other
files.

&gt;<i>if you require floppy
</I>No, I said I didn't.  Actually I have a Coyote router at home, so I
know what floppy systems are for.

&gt;<i>once you get a compact flash and start playing with it you will see it works
</I>&gt;<i>very nicely.
</I>
I've got an sbc on order but until then I'm going to target a hard
drive.  The Adventure continues in next message...

Thanks!

&gt;<i>I should point out that I don't need my system to fit on a
