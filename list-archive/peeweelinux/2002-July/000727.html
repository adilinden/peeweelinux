<PRE>&gt;<i>Barry:
</I>&gt;<i>         I only change the target 'style', the hole system is the same and 
</I>&gt;<i>the machine is the same (video card, mouse, etc.). As it is only 
</I>&gt;<i>uncompressed (or RO partition with multiple RAM) and the files fits without 
</I>&gt;<i>problem in the drive, I cannot know anything because if I comment the line 
</I>&gt;<i>with the Xserver in the rc file, all works fine, but if the Xserver is 
</I>&gt;<i>enabled, it locks the target PC. I cannot acces any log file.
</I>
If you do have a console attached, you could boot up in 
runlevel 3 [ change this line in  etc/inittab :

id:5:initdefault

 change the 5 to a 3 and recopy your system ]  then you'll get a 
login prompt.  Once logged in you type startx.   Well, I hope it's
startx, but embedded X may be stripped down to a simpler command.
This might let you find out what's up with X.

&gt;<i>         Is OK for me to use it compressed, but I think that can be faster 
</I>&gt;<i>to load an uncompressed file system. 
</I>
With a slow hard drive and a fast processor, it's faster to load 
less from the hard drive and let the CPU uncompress it.  But with 
a flash disk and a not-so-fast processor, it may be the other way
around  You would have to test it.

&gt;<i>Better if I can save the memory for 
</I>&gt;<i>the RAM disk using a RO root partition. Maybe I'm wrong in this, but the RO 
</I>&gt;<i>filesystem with multiple RAM disks was faster and uses less memory than any 
</I>&gt;<i>other configuration. (this two tips are very important to me now). Please 
</I>&gt;<i>let me know if any of this asseverations is not right.
</I>
I don't know enough about this to help.

Barry
