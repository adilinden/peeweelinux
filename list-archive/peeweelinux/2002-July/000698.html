I solved this one by upgrading to kernel 2.4.18 (see my howto in 
previous list archives), and then using ext3 as the filesystem for the 
3rd &quot;leftover&quot; partition as (mounted as /opt on boot).  Here's a small 
script I use that makes/populates /dev/sda3 after PWL rebuilds the flash 
card:

   #!/bin/sh

   echo &quot;Creating filesystem...&quot;
   mke2fs -j -b 1024 -m0 /dev/sda3

   echo &quot;Populating filesystem...&quot;
   mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 /mnt/usbdev
   cp -a /usr/local/pwl/Embedded_Build/opt_tree/* /mnt/usbdev/

   echo &quot;Syncing and unmounting...&quot;
   sync
   umount /mnt/usbdev

So, of course, this requires you keep the &quot;master&quot; /opt tree on your 
build machine.  Couple this ext3 filesystem with a SanDisk industrial 
grade CF disk, and you're set.  I've had nothing but good luck with ext3 
recovers.

</I>
Besides my /opt dealio above, I just make custom .tar files that mimic 
the PWL shipped ones, and throw them right into the mix.  They then show 
up nicely in ./pwlconfig and you can just select them.  See the 2.4.18 
howto, once again, for how I did this. Your mileage may vary. ;)

&gt;<i> 3. In the same regard, certain config files need to be updated during operation of 
</I>
Make them symlinks to the files loaded on /opt (or just copy them over 
from /opt on boot) and you're set.  Of course, make sure /opt is mounted 
before doing anything fun. ;)
