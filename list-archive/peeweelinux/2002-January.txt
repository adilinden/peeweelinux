Message-ID: <AAE57540F048D4118C8A0050047A2BD0580CA1@mail_lutt.xko.co.uk>

I have a Sandisk SDDR-31 connected to my USB port and am trying to write the
filesystem to this target. Everything appears to go OK, the files are
transferred and it says that it has run lilo on /dev/sda, but when I try and
boot off it (as /dev/hda using a cf-ide converter), the furthest I have got
is to the dreaded 'LI.......'. Is there anything that I should check before
condemning the cheapo flash card I bought as dud. If you require any further
info I would be glad to oblige.

Thanks in advance

What does your lilo.conf file look like?

I think Dan's basic problem is running lilo on a device
(/dev/sda) which is not known to the bios at boot time.
During boot, the bios probably regards the Sandisk as
an IDE device and thinks of it as the C drive.

Try telling lilo that it should play along with the
bios' assumptions. In lilo.conf, you probably have:

boot=/dev/sda

Right after that add:

disk=/dev/sda
<TAB>bios=0x80

This will tell lilo to have the first stage boot loader
use bios disk 0x80 instead of whatever drive number
it previously thought /dev/sda to be.

Good luck.

Hi,

The "bios  = 0x80" refers to the bios disk the boot loader is to be booted 
from. Without it lilo would assume "/dev/sda" which is incorrect since it 
is actually "/dev/hda" in the actual target system. The boot loader is 
actually installed on "/dev/sda".

Hi,

Look at the custom files in pwlconfig.  This allows you to add your own 
files to the filesystem or replace files provided by peeweelinux...

Hi,

The different kernel may be an issue. PWL was built on RedHat 6.2 with a 
minimized glibc library of RedHat 6.2. It is quite possible that Mandrake 
8.1 uses different libs than PWL which then could cause problems.

A solution would be to compile your application static or use a RedHat 6.2 
system for development.

Hi

I am also interested in such a product, but with a few additions.  I would like to build one with 3 cards, 2 for 802.11b, one for 802.11a, and then a relay radio to act as the backbone between nodes.

I am thinking that it would be great if it could also cache web pages as this would speed things up.  Then my friends could share a T1 connection in our area.

This is probably more processing power than the orinoco solution has, maybe an AMD Athlon is needed.

One of the challenges is the same that Adi ran into - heat - only my problem is worse, as I want to put it outside in CA, where it is 45 C in the summer.

I think it may be easier to get drivers for proxim, as they sell a driver development kit, and seem open to working with people.  I live only 30 Km from their office in CA

Thanks

Hi all,

I have found the reason why when I cannot boot from the peeweelinux installation on my compact flash card! Whenever I put the card in the cf-ide converter, it either cannot read or corrupts the partition table! I haven't worked out if it is the mobo, the cf-ide conv or the cf card itself. The other thing I cannot work out is what the geometry of the card should be. It is detected by the mobo bios as 4 heads 16 sectors and 500 cylinders, but cfdisk (or fdisk or sfdisk) SOMETIMES reported it as 2 x 16 x 500 or 2 x 8 x 1000 !!!

In short, has anybody had similar problems with cf cards or does anybody know of a source of information for using cf cards under linux.

Cheers

Dan

Hi,

What are you using to load the filesystem onto the card? What is the make

I had problems with my cf card and in the end I put a dos filesystem on
it and used loadlin in the autoexec.bat to load the linux kernel. 

I realize that this isn't the best way to to do this, but I just
couldn't make it boot from a linux filesystem.

Hi Dan,

Did you try forcing the geometry the BIOS reports onto the card? I would 
suggest trying to manually fdisk the card to see if you can get it 
partitioned, formatted and mounted.

I take it you are using the cf card via a CF-IDE adapter?

Hi,

Have you considered syslinux as bootloader? It works from a DOS filesystem 
but doesn't require any DOS related files.

I have considered using syslinux but it feels like a bit of a cop out. Why
use a DOS partition (using up valuable blocks on my cf card) to work around
problems that I don't understand? Seems like a bit of a Micro$haft approach!
Why would a DOS partition behave when others don't? Is it the BIOS
implementation on my mobo? I will persevere with what I am doing at the
moment which is using sfdisk to partition the drive and dd to manipulate the
bootsector. At least I am learning a hell of a lot about partitioning and
bootloading.

By the way, I use the Sandisk USB flash reader/writer to partition the card
'cause I heard there were problems with the cf-ide adaptor.

Cheers y'all.

Dan

Hi Dan,

You're the first one reporting problems partitioning the CF Card using the 
USB reader. Your description of the problem is very similar to what 
prompted me to post the warning about using the CF-IDE adapter to 
partition CF devices. This makes me wonder whether it is really an issue 
with the adapter? I am using Sandisk and Kingston cards in 4MB, 16MB, 
32MB, 64MB sizes and never had the problem described using the USB reader.

I am using syslinux primarily because I find it more convenient. I don't 
have to rerun lilo on the device when changing kernel or ramdisk image. In 
fact, I can access the CF using another OS to replace kernel and ramdisk 
if necessary. The syslinux approach isn't that good if you require an 
uncompressed filesystem on the CF card.

Regards,
Adi

hi,

  thank you. I used hard-disk.At one time,I load the system into a hard-disk,but it couldn't work,show L 00 00 00.this hard-disk is defined A .then I load system of A into another hard-disk(B) with ghost software. after B booted,it didn't show the same error information.

 except that the BIOS, there has other possible cause?

thanks

after I loaded the system into my hard-disk(B), my object hard-disk(B) is hdc. file /tmp/lilo.conf:

Hi,

    I decided on Compact Flash Cards as they are
cheap.But do I need to have a CF-IDE adapter or can I
socket it directly onto the motherboard?

Please Help.

Look at http://www.peeweelinux.com/#products

you'll find one the plugs directly into the M/B and ones that use IDE
cables. 

We use the 3"5 adaptors because our enclosure is very slim, but for a
regural PC case you can use pretty much everything. See
http://www.ituner.com for an implementation example. The CF sticking out
of the MediaBox audio encoder is the 3.5" adaptor.

Using pwl 0.61.0 and a SanDisk USB reader/writer with a Viking 128Mb CF.

Just starting out, I put the minimal project to the CF. Tweaked the MSN

Hitting enter, I get a "Block move error 0xNNNN", where NNNN is a number that
isdifferent each time.

But lilo continues to load the kernel.

Kernel bootstraps. Right after mounting the "drives" I get the following error:

I read the following thread:

Selecting the whole kernel didn't fix my problem.

A couple of thoughts (if you haven't tried them already):

Try changing Device Mount Point to "./mnt"

Check the "Boot Device on Target System" option.  It should probably be
"/dev/sda".

There is some context sensitive help built into pwlconfig.  Select
"Configure Target Hardware" and then "Help".  There is also a filed called
README.pwlconfig in the Embedded_Build/scripts directory that contains some
useful information.

Based on the description of your problem, it sounds like you may need to
configure a "custom" kernel specifically for your application.

In my case (8MB bootable DiskOnChip), I had to use a custom 2.4.17 kernel on
the target, rather than the 2.2 era kernel included with Peewee.

For what it's worth, here's some more information on some of the Peewee
Linux Project options, as I understand them:

    Project Mount Point: mnt
        This is a directory where your project will be "extracted" to.
    Device Mount Point: ./mnt
        This is where pwlconfig will default to mounting your device.

Typically, you shouldn't need to change these options.  If you have a
project called "test", the complete file system for the target would be
created under Embedded_Build/projects/test/mnt.  After you use the "Extract
File System for Project" option, this directory will contain the entire file
system.  I often find it useful to manually go into this directory (and
subdirectories) just to see what was extracted, prior to actually copying it
to the target device.

    IDE Flash (or HD) Target Parameters
    Target Device: /dev/sda
        The target device name on the development system your PeeWeeLinux
        system will be build on. Be careful here. The target build script
        will destroy any existing content on this device!

      Boot Device: /dev/hda
         How the target device will be known as on the final target system.

These target parameters are used when you're ready to copy the complete
project file system created earlier.  Peewee Linux is using the "Target
Device" parameter to automatically copy the file system to the target, which
could be a floppy, Compact flash, DiskOnChip device, etc.

I'm not sure how this works with compact flash, but my DiskOnChip part is
accessed via "/dev/nftla".  In my case, the target device is specified as
"/dev/nftla".  Peewee Linux handles the partitioning (fdisk), file system
creation (ext2 or FAT), file copying, and boot record creation
automatically.

Incidentally, if the Linux system does not recognize your target, the "Load
File System onto Target" option will always fail.  As a quick sanity check,
try "sfdisk -l /dev/xx" where xx is your actual target.

If the "Load File System onto Target" option was successful, the target
device should now be bootable.

The "Boot Device" option specifies where the root file system is located.
After the kernel boots, it will attempt to find and mount the root file
system on the device specified.  Unless the root file system is not on the
target device itself (for instance, a CD-ROM or harddrive), this option
should be the same as the Target Device.

I hope this helps,

Mark

Is the free space on ramdisk in kilobytes?

I'm assuming that 2000 really is 2048, correct?

Your changes got the MSN companion to boot linux, so I'm off and running now.
