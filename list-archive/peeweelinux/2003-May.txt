Subject: [Peeweelinux] How to load a linux kernel from a USB Iomega Zip device.
Message-ID: <HDTO09F0A6YXJFKIZX3NHQOLKVUSNHG.3eb106fc@workstation>

Hi all,

is there a boot loader capable to load a linux kernel and a mini linux file
system, from a USB Iomega Zip device?
In other words I want that at the PC startup the Bios executes the boot
loader from a floppy disk, and it must load the USB drivers and then run the
kernel code from the USB Zip device. Is it possible that?
Any suggestion is very apreciated.
Thanks.
Michele

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Adding Custom RPMS
Message-ID: <3EB1D0CE.8060604@iinet.net.au>

Hi

I would like to get a few more programs working on peeweelinux. Namely 
sndconfig to configure my sound card and comedi to configure my PCM-3730 
I/O controller.

I notice that the "Configure Custom Files" allows you to update single 
files or add whole directories however this is no good if you want to 
add an RPM or make install an application.

I notice that "/Embedded_Build/RPMS" holds all the rpm files for the 
"Configure file system menu" which somehow have been loaded into a 
directory "/Embedded_Build/packages". If you enter one of these 
directories for arguments sake lets use "/Embedded_Build/RPMS/Editors" 
you would get the following listing:
ee.list    e.tar    nano.list    nano.tar    vim-ncurses.list    
vim-ncurses.tar    vim.list    vim.tar

SO THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS -  How do I take an RPM file for eg 
"sndconfig-0.43-1.i386.rpm" (Redhat 6.2 file) and add it to say the 
directory /Embedded_Build/packages/Applications_Sound in the format 
"sndconfig.tar sndconfig.list?

So that when I launch ./pwlconfig and go into Configure file systems and 
then enter Applications_Sound I will have the option of selecting sndconfig?

Would be great if someone could do a HOWTO for this question because it 
is never dealt with fully in the archives however I would love to be 
proved wrong.

Thanks

Correy

pwlconfig extracts the rpm files into the .list and .tar files.

But how do you add them?

If I were to add an rpm file to the rpm directory where will it extract into a .list and .tar file?

If so will it automatically appear within the "Configure Project File System". I have tried adding rpm files to the /Embedded_Build/RPMS dir but they are not extracted to a .tar or .list file nor can they be seen in pwlconfig.

Am I right in assuming that the "Configure Custom files" is not used for configuring rpms?

Thanks for a fast reply though

Message-ID: <08F9C91BD42DD411A48900C04F109FD45C0504@atlaspdc.atlas-tech.com>

My build is basically the same each time except I do most of my changes to
the custom folder.  I have a script already that takes all of my custom
files I need and places them into a custom folder under the project I am
working on.  

My question is which script do I use under the /scripts folder that
completes the same task as "Extract File System For Project" under the Main
Menu in the pwlconfig GUI? Basically this script would take the custom files
and combine those with the selected packages and creates the mnt folder
under my project.  The I would run the /scripts/pwl_target script to create
my ramdisk image from my mnt folder and copy it to my target device which is
my DOC.

Any help would be appreciated

  2.how to disable the mouse and keyboard.

Message-ID: <sebb772e.027@qatech.com>

ITs better not to run your app as root, as you know, so you would need some way of performing root operations in order to change IP address dynamically maybe the SUDO program could help here. Or, better yet, if you could change it in a startup script as root before the autologin user takes charge. Just put a script in custom/etc/rcS.d  in order to do this. Just be wary of other network config scripts that may start before or after it. 

If you need to change the application only once at setup, then you can change it in the config files. I think I setup autobootX so that it relies on a DHCP server, but you can muck around with the config files in etc in order to change this. 

Mouse and keyboard I think can be disabled in XFree86 .. I think the mouse is somehting like "AllowMouseOpenFail" or some option like that. Maybe there is something similar for keyboard as well.

Hi everybody,
I tried to add a telnet server to my custom project using inetd, but when I
try to connect to it I obtain the following error message:
> telnetd: All network ports in use

I don't have any other service listening on any ports, so why all ports
should be in use?

Did I forget something like setting up ports for the service?

Thank you for any replies

Hi

I have created a Peewee Distribution successfully. However I need to run an
application on it which depends on libc 2.2 .
My development environment is red hat 8.0. I tried to extract the rpm of
libc 2.2 and its dependencies using the Manage Package Files option of
pwlconfig.

However, going through the archives I figured that the rpm is an older
version and I'm not able to extract the rpm file. So I did not get a .tar
and .list file .

What is the best way to upgrade the libc library?

Thanks

Vasanth

P.S. I'm Peeweelinux, so go easy on me.

Thanks

I am developing a new ATM (Automated Teller Machine) for a company and am wanting to use peewee linux. I have created a bootable CF disk for my embedded board. I need support for a PCI Modem that I have. What do I need to do to get peewee linux to support my pci modem. All I need to do to get my modem to work is to do a setserial command. But when I do a cat /proc/pci it does not exist.

Do I need to use a newer kernel version, or can I just add PCI support to the kernel included with PeeWee Linux?

Thanks in advance for any help

You might check, but the "full" kernel is called not "bzImage" but instead "bzImage-full". Is this what is happening?

Ken:

I did not find anything that started with bzImage.

I have setup a new build system today. I am using Redhat 9 personnel
edition. If I try and do anything other then using basic kernel. The
only reason that I was trying to create a custom kernel was because my
PCI devices were not showing up. If I try to do the following command
cat /proc/pci it tells me that no such file or directory. 

I am also getting the following error when I run minicom with the basic
kernel.

Minicom: error in loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.4: cannot open
shared object file: no such file or directory

I am loading this on a 128MB CF.

What can I do to resolve these issues.

Thanks,

Joe

Mr. Ken Emmons,

I've been trying to get a small linux distrobution that runs X on a=20
small compact flash for about a month now.  And, while looking through=20
some mailing list archives, I stumbled accross your AutoBoot X Windows=20
project, and I am very interested in getting it to work.

Where can I go to download your bootx.tgz?  I've searched in the=20
standard download locations for peeweelinux, but haven't found it.

-Daniel
