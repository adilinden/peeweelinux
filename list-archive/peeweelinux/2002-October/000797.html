<PRE>I've got a couple of problems I'm hoping the sharp
folks here can help me with.  I'm pretty experienced
with linux and embedded systems, but new to peewee
and not done a ton of bootdisk stuff.

My system is a transmeta crusoe PC104 with an
aaeon 3115B PCMCIA adapter.  I also have an IDE-&gt;
Compact Flash Adapter.

I've tried the wireless-isa example with similar results
as my own custom kernel.  Here's what happens:

1) Build system on development system and write to
16MB CompactFlash card using USB Reader/Writer.

2) Install card in compact flash adapter on IDE
string.

3) Power on.  I get the following error

loading ramdisk...................................
loading bzImage........

  - crc error -

system halted


Any thoughts?  Do I somehow need to modify the kernel
building to use zImage?  What script would I need to
modify?



A second problem I have is when I'm trying to boot from
PCMCIA with the compact flash card in a PCMCIA-&gt;CF
Adapter.  The PCMCIA PC104 card I have has a special
boot EEPROM on it.  After fiddling with the jumpers, I
am able to boot from a compact flash card with a
bootable DOS filesystem on it.  When I try to boot the
above linux filesystem, the system indicates that
I need to insert a system disk - It's not seeing the bootable
filesystem.  

Any Ideas?

I suppose that it is possible that the boot eeprom firmware
only recognizes the dos filesystem.  If I wanted to create a 
bootable partition with a minimal dos and syslinux to boot
the system (a hack, but in this operation, it wouldn't be
too bad as long as I can modify the PWL scripts to generate
the system...)

Any thoughts about how I would best go about modifying or adding
scripts to do this?

Thanks,
murph
