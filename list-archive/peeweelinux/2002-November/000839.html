<PRE>Hi,

You're asking a difficult question. I have a list of things I'd like to do 
with PeeWeeLinux. Perhaps the most significant is to build a dedicated 
build environment that one chroots into for building PeeWeeLinux binaries. 
This would be part of the source distribution. The idea is to make 
PeeWeeLinux independent of the underlying Linux distribution and version.
Now the binaries were linked against the existing system libraries, then 
the binaries will be linked against PeeWeeLinux libraries.

Beyond that, I think 2.4.x kernal is need in addition to what's there and 
some of the binaries need to be updated. With the above environment and 
proper scripting it should be pretty easy to rebuild all of the 
PeeWeeLinux packages automatically. A big improvement when it comes to 
updating libraries. That might even allow for a PeeWeeLinuxLite version, 
linked against ulibc...

Right now my problem is time. I mentioned the above before and hoped long 
time ago to have time to work on PeeWeeLinux again. My job has not brought 
any new embedded Linux projects as I hoped, instead im very busy building 
a satellite network. What little time I have left is mostly spend with 
family. What I need is a couple of weeks or so of uncommited evenings to 
get the basics of the ground. I am now hoping for that break to come 
shortly after Christmas, all the things that keep me busy now should be 
wrapped up then.

I open to input, if anyone wants to contribute and make these things 
happen, I'd love to assist in any way I can to get things integrated 
smoothly and take PeeWeeLinux to the next level.
