Well I got this problem solved.  It turns out that my machine is just slow.  I
started up pwl again and just let it run extracting the packages while I went
and did something else.  I came back later that night and it was finished.

Sorry for the trouble.  And thanks for the help.

No, my friend, the way to have good and safe government, is not to trust it
all to one, but to divide it among the many, distributing to every one exactly
the functions he is competent to.  It is by dividing and subdividing these
republics from the national one down through all its subordinations, until it
ends in the administration of every man's farm by himself; by placing under
every one what his own eye may superintend, that all will be done for the
best.
