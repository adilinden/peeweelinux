<PRE>I grabbed a copy of 0.52-bin and gave it a try.  First problem I notice is
that it complains about various directories not existing.  The only one I
seem to have been affected by so far is ./Embedded_Build/rd_tmp.  Others  
already scrolled out of my scrollback buffer - sorry.

Now I'm having trouble installing a pwl system to /dev/hdd.  It is a 2Gig 
laptop hard drive.  The first problem I ran into was that the first time I
tried to &quot;extract&quot; the system to the hard drive, it tried to do it to
/dev/sda, even though I had already changed the device in the defaults to
/dev/hdd.  Exiting and re-starting seemed to get the change to /dev/hdd to
take.  Next, it can't seem to install lilo, but it just says 
&quot;failed&quot;.  Here's the output:

Any idea why it fails?

Oh, and that spelling error on the 7th line from the bottom really is in
there ;)
