Subject: [Peeweelinux] menus ** and ~~
Message-ID: <2.2.16.20020731173951.6b57a5a4@zmicro.com>

   What is the meaning, in the pwlconfig menus, of the characters:

   package foo    -->    menu under here.
[*]package foo ** -->    everything is (not selected)
[*]package foo ~~ -->    some things (nothing) is selected

Close? Wrong? Random?

Deselecting the field at the far left means it won't use anything 
in there, whether it's selected or not, right?  (You can tell I
haven't spent a lot of time in Menuconfig either).

I get conflicting results everytime I try to predict what I'll see.
I guess it's important to know what I've actually selected :)

Subject: [Peeweelinux] kernel building problems
Message-ID: <2.2.16.20020731181638.8e8f8aee@zmicro.com>

Scripts are a double edged sword.  They are great until something
doesn't work.

I did a whole kernel compile without ever seeing a command line!
It *says* it worked--is it that smart?

When I try to "Load File System onto Target" I get an error here:

 Copying the ramdisk....ok
 Copying the kernel....failed        

There are a *lot* of scripts in there.   I haven't yet determined
how to tell which one does what (if that even makes sense). 
More to the point, though, I don't see a bzimage in my 
project tree.   Shouldn't someone somewhere have linked it all
together and compressed it as well?

Seems I have a kernel tar file in which the boot directory is
empty.   Lots of .o files, though

I have a feeling if I "build the kernel" again it will start
over.  I don't want to do that too often on this 166 Pentium.

I'm wary of trying to "build by hand" because of the "real" RH7.3
system with the 2.4 kernel -- I bet pwlconfig modifies
some environment variables before setting off on its adventures.

Hi John,

I honestly don't know. I've been working away on it slowly but I have very 
little time for PeeWeeLinux right now. I hope to have something worth 
releasing before the end of the year.

Message-ID: <2.2.16.20020805125639.71cfa972@zmicro.com>

So you all saw my lament about building a custom kernel, and
smiled to yourselves, thinking, "He'll find out soon enough".  Well,
he's found out alright; I'd just suggest that if I could get through
this sooner I might have some time to contribute to the project.
Your punishment is you get to read the same answers again.

I post this now because there are always new people always coming by 
and this needs to stay visible.

Problem: Redhat 7.3, "Compile the Kernel" succeeds, but "Load 
File System onto Target" fails.  A little digging reveals that no
kernel image (bzImage) was ever produced.

Reason: "Compile the Kernel" did NOT succeed. 

   Reason: checksum.S did not compile (ok, assemble).

      Reason: gcc version 2.96 is broken.

         Reason: Red Hat distributed it with 7.0 +

Okay, solutions.

First of all, (Ralph,) be aware that the pwlconfig script won't 
catch this!  So don't be mislead.  If you want to check, go on
to the next step  "Create Custom Kernel Package (not rpm!)",
then go back to "Configure Project File System -->",
"Kernel_Custom -->",     then select the kernel you just built, 
and look in the list for /boot/bzImage.  If you only see /boot, 
then you didn't get a kernel.

Next, RedHat supplies an older version of gcc especially for
compiling kernels.  It's called kgcc.  It's an older egcs-2.91.66
compiler that works just fine.  It should already be on your
system.  Try 'which kgcc' and 'kgcc --version' to be sure.  There
is no kgcc.rpm on my disks so I don't know where it came from.
All you need to do now, to use it, is to edit your Makefile.  This is in  

Embedded_Build/kernelbuild/usr/src/linux-2.2.17-13

find the "cc" line:

CC      =$(CROSS_COMPILE)kgcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)

change "cc" to "kgcc" as I have done, 
then compile once again, and things will start to
work.


About that "2.96 is broken" remark.  This was a development
version that should not have been distributed.  The GNU 
folks moved the version up to 2.97 in response and announced
there would never be a stable version of 2.96  (So you'll know
they are all broken).   I remember the discussions at the time
(remember this was almost two years ago) and while I didn't
retain all the kernel-related particulars I do know it 
reinforced my own feelings that I should get a good version
(2.95) and refuse to upgrade it until someone (several 
someones!) announced an "all clear".  

searching on "bzImage" or "checksum" will find similar 
problems and answers like this one.

Hi Barry,

Have you seen Troy Engel's "kernel 2.4 mini-howto"?  It has detailed 
instructions that may be relevant:

http://mail.adis.on.ca/pipermail/peeweelinux/2002-June/000608.html

Also, for what it's worth, I usually just include my custom kernel (bzImage) 
as a "custom" file, effectively replacing the one created by Peewee.  This is 
certainly not the most *elegant* way to do this (Troy's method is better), 
but it does allow me to control the kernel building process independent of 
Peewee's scripts or compiler dependencies.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] compiling old kernel on new Red Hat, as86
Message-ID: <2.2.16.20020805153825.841f11d2@zmicro.com>

This is an addendum to my adventure building kernels.

Spoiler:  I ended up needing as86, and it's in the dev86 rpm.
          I needed kgcc as well and it's in an egcs rpm.

Story: As a PeeWeeLinux hacker, I'm inclined toward minimalist
systems.  So, when I do installs, I look for things to
leave out, things I'll never use.  Also the questions in those
installs are rather general, so I'm dealing with large sections
of the system at a time.   So it came to pass that I found it
would be nice to have gcc in there for the occasional C program
or test.   That wasn't a problem because there's an rpm for
it.  Then I discovered that just about any utility program I
wanted to compile wanted to see the kernel-headers so I installed 
those, too.    On the next system install I chose  "development".
For that I got, gcc, the kernel, plus the sources for perl, python, 
XFree86, GNOME, java, emacs, ...  I decided to go back to 
installing the packages myself.  Now I keep a list, so I also
know the dependencies.

This weekend I decided to duplicate my efforts and build a 
peewee system on my laptop, which happens to be faster than
the target system I'm building it on here.  I thought the
kernel would compile faster as well.   Oh, it was real
fast.  It was bombing out because kgcc wasn't there.

Now, I didn't know where kgcc came from but I had decided the Magic
must work all the time so I didn't worry about it (see my 
previous message).  Now confronted with this problem I did 
some more searching.   Knowing that kgcc was "the kernel's gcc"
and that in turn was an older version and that it was called
"egcs" back then, I was finally able to locate it in the package
"compat-egcs-6.2-1.1.2.16.i386.rpm"   There is one dependency
so you'll need "compat-glibc-6.2-2.1.3.2.i386.rpm" as well.
These names are for Red Hat 7.3, anyway.

So now I was ready to build the kernel for real.  Everything 
was fine until it couldn't find the program as86.  Back to
research.   It turns out this is the assembler, and it
is in "dev86-0.15.5-1.i386.rpm" for Red Hat.  My searching
turned up the same thing with "bin86" as the package for 
debian users.  Seems as86 is an 8086 real-mode assembler 
for creating code for the boot code in the kernel and the 
boot block for lilo.

Now that I can compile the kernel, I can go back to figuring
out how pwlconfig deals with all of that.

One problem is that I set EXTRAVERSION in the makefile so I 
could be sure it was booting the kernel that I had built...but 
it doesn't show up!  Fortunately the date does, so I think 
I've got the real thing.

No, but I saw a reference to it.  For some reason I was never able
to locate it.  I had downloaded the archives and imported them to 
my mail reader, so it was a search problem.   Thanks to your link, 
I have it in my sights now.

I found that if I save the result of "packaging the kernel" into a
directory of my own naming, it shows up in the package selection
for the project just like the "stock" kernel does.  So far seems
to work.  Sounds similar to what you are doing.  Unless you are
able to manage the sources separately.

So much of using pwlconfig is tied up in undestanding what it's 
trying to do.   It helps to know how to do it in the first place.
I have a lot better picture of kernel making now that I've done
it by hand a few times.

Thanks for the lead.

Barry

I set EXTRAVERSION in the Makefile so that the kernel I

there.  And it has disappeared from the Makefile after
compilation.  This time I checked to make sure it was
there before I started compiling.   So somewhere it
is getting removed.  And my fix for cc -> kgcc is
still there, so the file is not being overwritten.

If the scripts do it intentionally, are they perhaps
trying to copy it from somewhere else that I can set?

If you are using pwlconfig to compile the kernel, the scripts will modify 
EXTRAVERSION I believe. 

If you need to make changes to the kernel sources beyond whats 
configurable in pwlconfig, I would suggest building a kernel using 
prestine kernel sources and including the resulting kernel and modules as 
custom files.

I think I proved that.  The question was how, or what?  If it is
being erased on purpose then there is probably a reason.  If it is
being substituted from elsewhere then if I know the location of
'elsewhere' I could put it there and be happy.   

They warned me that when compiling kernels, it's a good idea to
change EXTRAVERSION so that the modules built with one kernel
don't accidentally wind up in another.   Your packaging scheme
makes this less likely, though you never want to underestimate
the ingeniousness of fools...

I understand that Ralph wrote a lot of the scripts and so you
don't have all the answers.  It's also obvious you guys don't
have a lot of time to throw at this.   I'm trying to get a 
clue for the design behind the scripts so that I can find some
of my own answers.   I do like the way the options are keyed
to file and directory names.  Makes it easy to know what
to choose.   It also lets me manage them (rename or delete)
from outside pwlconfig without having to know too much.

I'm really trying to "stay inside the lines" until such time that I
really know what I'm doing.

My question is: Are there modifications to the code here, or 
are all the packages "stock"?   I see a lot of "roll your own"
suggestions but I keep thinking there are some "tweaks" applied
that make the target system work.   I mean changes to code,
not things like simplyfying startup scripts.   It's a question
of whether I can expect to be able to go get some package
and be able to use it as is.   I was surprised that you
can apparently use a 2.4 kernel "as is".   Namely because
I also hear talk like "updating peewee to be able to use
a 2.4 kernel".   Maybe these are all library issues?

I've got a system now, with a reconfigured kernel, network drivers,
and I am able to ping other addresses.  Now I'm working on 
making thttpd work.   Doubtless you'll hear about that soon :)

Thanks for all your effort.

Message-ID: <2.2.16.20020813170037.903f6ee8@zmicro.com>

With my embedded system actually running, I try to start
the web server.  From the command prompt, I type thttpd
and I get:

  modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module net-pf-10

(Your mileage may vary on this one, since I have a funny 
configuration issue at this time: depmod needs to be run
first, but it doesn't; then something tries to modprobe
and I don't know who (probably network) is doing it).  

Anyway, research on net-pf-10 turns out to be a reference
to IPV6, which is something thttpd claims to be capable of,
so I believe it.  Further research claims the fix is 
to "alias net-pf-10 off".

The problem with this is, the shell I get (ash?) does not 
support aliases, and the shell is apparently where aliases 
come from.   Attempts to put bash on there gives me a 
different shell, but prompts, command history, aliases, and 
so on don't work.  (Probably a configuration issue but
I'm in too deep already).  Maybe if I could get rid of
the attempt to access net-pf-10 I could dispense with all
this alias stuff.

But all the above is not real.  Such is the price of trying
to build these things  yourself.   After repeatedly trying
to run ps I finally got that put into the target, and once
I was able to do ps ax, I found that thttpd was running
already, and had been the whole time.   In fact, the 
error I get is from running it at the command line when 
it's running already, and though I don't know why it says
what it says, it is a non-problem since the server's already
running.

I still have to start eth0 by hand, but that's next on the list.

Thanks for the response.  I don't need ipv6 and thttpd turned up
working, but I still am trying to find all the loose ends of
the startup scripts.

How does that "alias" think work?  I have "made up" explanations
for many things and while they often turn out to be right I am
always watching for that clue that I've got it wrong.  So I need
to know who reads modules.conf, and how the alias is handled.  I'm
thinking that it may well be a shell script, maybe it sources the
modules.conf file, but that would point back to the shell needing
to keep aliases....I think I will do some digging around in my host
system for this.

Hi,

I am seeing quite a few messages on the list covering various 
documentation aspects of PeeWeeLinux. This is great and having the list 
archives will be a great resource. 

I think there needs to be a central location for documentation somehow. 
I've some sites use faq-o-matic and wiki to collect and build 
documentation. I like the wiki concept. Question, is there interest in 
contributing and collecting information for PeeWeeLinux using a wiki system?

Thanks,
Adi

I'm not exactly sure what loads modules.conf. One of the system startup
scripts catches it, which is then used by modprobe to start up kernel
modules. The "alias" command, I believe..is just simply that. another name
for which to call a module. Modprobe seems to use some standard naming when
trying to figure out which modules to load. Especially for sound modules.

In PWL, you don't need to use the alias command. What I did, was to put the
insmod commands directly in rc.modules since rc.modules gets executed like a
shell script. You can ignore modules.conf unless you are going to have one
of your startup scripts use modprobe to determine what modules to load. Not
as elegant as a full-blown system...but then if i wanted a full blown
system, i'd just install from the cd.

Thanks for the response.  I don't need ipv6 and thttpd turned up
working, but I still am trying to find all the loose ends of
the startup scripts.

How does that "alias" think work?  I have "made up" explanations
for many things and while they often turn out to be right I am
always watching for that clue that I've got it wrong.  So I need
to know who reads modules.conf, and how the alias is handled.  I'm
thinking that it may well be a shell script, maybe it sources the
modules.conf file, but that would point back to the shell needing
to keep aliases....I think I will do some digging around in my host
system for this.

Ok, I did the research.

depmod and modprobe go together.  In fact, they share a common man
page.  It is depmod that will read and interpret modules.conf,
and it handles the alias lines itself, without the shell's help.

Here is a useful command I found:   

   modprobe -c

It will dump to the screen everything that it knows about.  (This
seems to be more than /lib/modules/2.2.17/modules.dep   Maybe
it's in the kernel?)   This includes 'path', 'alias', 'option',
most of which is put there by default (maybe compiled in, don't
know).

Since I've still got thttpd in the title, here is another tip:
Pipe the output of some command to a file in the web server's
directory, and you can view or fetch it over the network  using 
your web browser.  I do this because my target system doesn't 
have less, or more, or telnet, or ftp...

This would actually be in the startup script.  modprobe just
does the translation, having loaded up some aliases.

I can write a script to "bring everything up by hand" but I am
wary that I will install some package that conflicts with that
method.  Also I get the feeling the bring-up may already be in
there and I just don't understand how to tweak it just right.

Hmm, I don't seem to have an rc.modules directory...  Maybe I
will just create a few small scripts in rcS.d  That way they
will remain "visible" and not "fall into a crack".

Now that  you mention it, I already know what I want to load
(and if I didn't I would find out as soon as I looked at lsmod).
So I don't really need modprobe at all.   Hey maybe if I
removed it I would find out who is trying to call it!

Rather than the ability to change an existing document...i would suggest
having a feature to append to a document:

1. leaving a document open for editing...could cause loss of original data
2. a natural progression of events and discussions regarding a topic might
be helpful to
a user researching a problem.
3. as information is added to a document...mistakes can be kept
intact...allowing a user to know what NOT to do.

I've seen various bug tracking systems work this way. Its nice to see the
original issue with comments regarding what has been tried and what has
worked or failed.

just my 2 cents

When I needed to do this, I ended up modifying the pwl scripts to
accomplish it.

This was quite a few versions back though. The interface may be more
capable now.

Last Wednesday my embedded hardware arrived.  I got a DiskOnModule with
it.  It has an IDE connector on it.  I plugged it onto the host 
system's motherboard and let PeeWee write an image to it.   The 
only hitch I had was on the embedded hardware.  The disk module 
wouldn't respond.  Turns out there is an IDE master jumper that's 
routed to the power connector and the mating connector didn't 
have a wire there.  Once that was taken care of, the system booted!
On Thursday 8/15 I had an embedded web site running on our LAN.  

The hardware is an Arbor EmCore-i413 featuring the ZFx86 "Linux" chip.
 5V, 1A.  100 MHz (39 BogoMIPS, must be a 486)

The DiskOnModule is hard to find item that emulates an IDE drive. It's
built onto the back of an IDE connector and extends back less than
an inch.  The vendor (Modular Industrial Solutions) recommended
them as being less trouble than the DiskOnChip, and they cost 
less, too.   They sell the board and the disk.  http://www.modindsol.com

One month from the time I started.  Not too bad, seemed like more :)

My target system initially needed to be started by hand.  I have 
worked it out to the point where it's automatic now.  But there
is a lot of detail down there in those init scripts!  Here's
what I started with:

  - network card module present but I had to load it with "modprobe"
  - modprobe fails because no modules.dep
  - modules.dep is created by "depmod"
  - have to run "depmod"
  - have to run ifconfig to bring up network card

Once the network is up the web server answers requests and all
is well.  Here is what I worked out to solve the above issues:

One premise I worked with was that the system really does know
how to to all this, and I just had something wrong.

I had already learned from adventure with thttpd and net-pf-10
about depmod and modprobe, so I created a task in rcS.d called
00depmod that would run first.  That was temporary and I moved
the depmod to another file later.

The issue with ifconfig led me through the 10Network script, 
wherein I found that it will find the ifcfg-eth0 file in
/etc/config and use the contents of that to construct an
appropriate ifconfig...up command.   The assumption that
this would work by itself proved to be correct after I
fixed the driver issue.   However, at this time I discovered
the place to put the IP address (or to set dhcp if I wish
to try that).

The driver modules was a little more interesting.  Looking
through the target scripts I find that there could be 
an /etc/rc.modules, which, if present, will read a file
/etc/modules and use that as a list of modules to
be loaded.   This pair of files was not present in my 
target system, nor was it present on my host RedHat system;
but they were present on my Coyote (LRP) system.  So, 
without any more clues, I decided to write my own rc.modules
file which runs depmod, then loads the modules for the
network card.  That way I have kept the customizations to a
minimum.  

I know that insmod will load modules without the help of
modules.dep   The issue of depmod was somewhat of an experimental
investigation (I figured I should know about it).  One thing
that seems to be likely is that depmod can be run on the
kernel libraries after they are compiled, and possibly the
resulting modules.dep can be copied to the target system and
then no depmod is required.

The last issue is that I put "alias eth0 ne2k-pci" into modules.conf
but I was unable to discover who reads that information.  That would
be the other way these modules get loaded (and seems to be the way
it's done in our real linux boxes.)

So the questions are:
  - what runs depmod during startup?
  - do embedded systems usually have a prebuilt modules.dep?
  - what uses modules.conf to find out what modules to load?

I usually use insmod and have it load the required modules in the 
proper sequence. This eliminates the need for depmod and /etc/modules.conf 
amongst things.

If you create /etc/config/ifcfg-eth0 with the appropriate content the 
network startup script will automatically configure the network interface. 
The syntax for the file is similar to RedHats. I.e.

  DEVICE=eth0
  IPADDR=192.168.1.1
  NETMASK=255.255.255.0
  
There is also support for specifying BROADCAST and NETWORK addresses if 
needed. If dhcp is used instead of static addressing do this instead:

  DEVICE=eth0
  BOOTPROTO=dhcp

This will reqire that either pump or dhcpcd are installed.

There is no automatic way to run depmod since the intend was to run insmod 
instead. So you would create an /etc/rc.modules containing something like:

  insmod ne2k-pci
  
And what ever else modules you need to load. If there are module 
dependencies you would need to add insmod lines for those in the proper 
order to satisfy dependencies.

Hope this helps,
Adi

That's what I did.  You might think it's bad that something's
lacking in the system but it's exactly what I wanted to hear.  That
way I can stop looking for it and get on with configuring it myself!

I think you meant "modules.dep" ; or do you put your insmod 
in something other than /etc/rc.modules as you described above?

Yes, I intended to explain that I had figured all this out by
way of reading the network script and such.  Also a lot of 
RedHat experience.

Thanks for the the help.

Not using modprobe eliminates the need to have a "/etc/modules.conf" file. 
Everything can be specified on the "insmod" command line. "modules.dep" is 
not required either, nor is "depmod"...

you can use modules.rc to load the module automatically on startup. since
it's probably only one module don't bother with modprobe.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] system initialization


My target system initially needed to be started by hand.  I have
worked it out to the point where it's automatic now.  But there
is a lot of detail down there in those init scripts!  Here's
what I started with:

  - network card module present but I had to load it with "modprobe"
  - modprobe fails because no modules.dep
  - modules.dep is created by "depmod"
  - have to run "depmod"
  - have to run ifconfig to bring up network card

Once the network is up the web server answers requests and all
is well.  Here is what I worked out to solve the above issues:

One premise I worked with was that the system really does know
how to to all this, and I just had something wrong.

I had already learned from adventure with thttpd and net-pf-10
about depmod and modprobe, so I created a task in rcS.d called
00depmod that would run first.  That was temporary and I moved
the depmod to another file later.

The issue with ifconfig led me through the 10Network script,
wherein I found that it will find the ifcfg-eth0 file in
/etc/config and use the contents of that to construct an
appropriate ifconfig...up command.   The assumption that
this would work by itself proved to be correct after I
fixed the driver issue.   However, at this time I discovered
the place to put the IP address (or to set dhcp if I wish
to try that).

The driver modules was a little more interesting.  Looking
through the target scripts I find that there could be
an /etc/rc.modules, which, if present, will read a file
/etc/modules and use that as a list of modules to
be loaded.   This pair of files was not present in my
target system, nor was it present on my host RedHat system;
but they were present on my Coyote (LRP) system.  So,
without any more clues, I decided to write my own rc.modules
file which runs depmod, then loads the modules for the
network card.  That way I have kept the customizations to a
minimum.

I know that insmod will load modules without the help of
modules.dep   The issue of depmod was somewhat of an experimental
investigation (I figured I should know about it).  One thing
that seems to be likely is that depmod can be run on the
kernel libraries after they are compiled, and possibly the
resulting modules.dep can be copied to the target system and
then no depmod is required.

The last issue is that I put "alias eth0 ne2k-pci" into modules.conf
but I was unable to discover who reads that information.  That would
be the other way these modules get loaded (and seems to be the way
it's done in our real linux boxes.)

So the questions are:
  - what runs depmod during startup?
  - do embedded systems usually have a prebuilt modules.dep?
  - what uses modules.conf to find out what modules to load?

I scanned my systems for a file "modules.rc" (And just now, the
Web.)  There isn't any such file.   I think you meant "rc.modules".
And this is what I did, I made an rc.modules, and it works.   The 
modprobe thing was to make sure I knew how to do that, in case I 
ever build a system that has a lot of modules or has a changing 
configuration.  And I have other Linux systems to mess with, too.

Yes, I saw this in the network script, and indeed, if the associated
config file is present and the card is live it will bring it up.

Thanks for the response.

What do I have to do to a given program to include it into 
a PeeWeeLinux system?  There are hints that when PeeWee was
built, that the packages were modified in some way.  Hints 
like, and my own guesses on...

 - built against the right kernel
 - stripped (remove debug symbols)
 - minimize footprint
 - rpm vs. tar file
 - (deadliest of all:) unknown

In one sense, I can take a working binary and just dump it
into the custom directory and have the system built with
it.  There are reasons this might be unworkable or cumbersome.
Or I could compile it myself and do the same, with somewhat 
better chances.  But what else do I need to know?

I need to do control apps via a web interface, so I'm currently
looking at web servers.  I need it to be a little fancy, so
I want something like php so I don't reinvent the last 8
years of cgi scripting progress.  So my choices are thttpd 
or Apache.   There's a php module for thttpd but it requires
a specific version of thttpd so I'd be building that again.
Apache looks like it might be too fancy for its own good, but
it's well-known and documented and all that.

The answers to the package questions are going to apply to 
anything I want to add to PeeWee, so it's a general question 
and not knowing could really get in the way.

All PeeWeeLinux packages are built using rpm. The "pwlconfig" scripts
convert rpms into tar files. When building the rpm, steps are taken to
minimize the footprint of the package by not including unneeded files,
stripping the binaries, linking only libraries actually available, etc.

Another important point is to use a RedHat 6.2 system for building rpms
otherwise the build binaries will not work with the PeeWeeLinux glibc.

It's long past time to change this. In the near future, I'll be adding
some scripts to allow toolchain building automatically, along the lines
of the gentoo project. Right now, I'm about halfway there. 6.2 is very
long in the tooth and does not play well with the newer X environments.
(Something else I'll be feeding back into the project over the next
several months.)

Message-ID: <3D6C2912.3F56F2EA@thebeavens.net>

I've recently downloaded and created a few project filesystems but I'm
very new to peewee. Can anyone tell me why
after i created a custom kernel with 6.2 and made a boot floppy , The
boot floppy works great. but when i go to install the new image to the
disk lilo gives me an error like " no binary image selected "  I must be
doing something wrong..
its just a bzImage file. is there something specific i need to do with
lilo or the image . normally i edit my lilo.conf replace line with the
new image and run lilo to write the changes.
can anyone help..
thanks

scratch that last request i fat fingered a name in the lilo.conf file..
Sorry ..
I have a real question now what utility do i use or how do i do this:
I have a binary rpm package that i want to include in the pwlconfig so when
i want to create a filesystem i can include
this package ...
how do i go about this, do i enter it manually somewhere or is there some
util to put it in the pwlconfig ..
your response is appreciated.
Pat
