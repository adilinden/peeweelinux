Subject: Needed: Simple PeeWee Linux Configuration with X & FrameBuffer Su
 pport
Message-ID: <D973CF70008ED411B273009027893BA409725D@irv-exch.phoenix.com>

I'm trying to put together a simple configuration with PeeWeeLinux 0.60 to
support X-Windows on a framebuffer device.  I've selected what appears to be
the appropriate packages for X (XFree86, XFree86-100dpi-fonts,
XFree86-75dpi-fonts, XFree86-FBDev, XFree86-libs, XFree86-stuff,
XFree86-twm, XFree86-xdm, XFree86-xfs, and xpm) and when I reboot to test my
system I get the error message "execve failed for /usr/X11R6/bin/X (errno
2)" after typing startx.  Looking around I noticed that a symlink from
Xwrapper -> X seems to be missing (at least that's the way it is on the RH
6.2 development system I'm using).  When I create the symlink and run startx
again I get a different error: "_X11TransSocketUNIXConnect: Can't connect:
errno = 111".  What do I have to do to create a simple configuration that
support X?

Hello in peeweelinux land.

I am looking for away to boot straight to an X-based
login prompt using XDM, instead of the old
black-and-white test console?

What I am looking for are example of the following
files.

.Xsession
.Xresource
.Xsetup_0
.Xservers

This unit is not connect to a network. insead the unit
is stand alone.

thanks

Subject: PEEWEE 0.53.27 network configuration? problem
Message-ID: <3A8E417C.4CB57FC8@vipco.de>

I have some problems to run my peewee linux box at the network. My goal
is to establish a simple telnet session to the linux box inside a
intranet (192.168.0.xxx).

I앐 working with peewee 0.53.27.

My peewee linux box has one network interface eth0 and my peewee system
is based onto the example project "wireless isa" and it압 network
scripts.

I have connected a laptop at the linux box. The ping command will work
fine from the laptop to the linux box and vice versa.

A Telnet session locally at the linux box will work properly, but an
attempt to start a telnet session from the laptop to the linuxbox will
fail. With tcpdump i can see the telnet request, but an answer from the
linux-box is missing.

A telnet session from the linux box to the laptop will fail, too. With
tcpdump I can see the request from the linux-box and the response from
the laptop but nothing more will happen.

It seems that all incoming ip-packets were lost at the linux box and
don앖 reach the application (INETD or TELNET).

In my tests i앐 working always with ip-addresses not with hostnames. I
build different systems with all peewee kernels and my own custom
kernel, but the result is always the same.

It seems to be a configuration problem.

Maybe I have to configure IP-masquerading or routing in a certain
manner?

Any idea why this isnt working?

Thank you for helping and reading my problem

Peter

Hi,

There shouldn't be unusual configurations necessary to get networking to
work. If you're working on a private network make sure the /etc/hosts file
contains the ip numbers and names of all the hosts you communicate with.
Telnet attempts to reverse resolve all ip numbers before allowing access.
This causes a timeout of a minute or two if there is no name associated
with the ip number.

If someone can tell me how to turn off the reverse DNS or even what does
it (inetd?) I'd be interested in making it disableable.

TTYL,
Adi

I had similar problems when I started using Redhat linux, it turned out
that when you try to start a telnet session linux looks up the incoming IP
address in the /etc/hosts file.  If it does not find it, it will sit there
for what seems like forever and then eventually give you the login prompt.
Adding a dummy entry to the hosts file fixed it.

Do you have telnet enabled in inetd.conf?

Hi,

I haven't worked with X on PeeWeeLinux in quite a long time. I think there
is symlink required from the X server (Xfbdev?) to X...

Yes, I need to build a basic X structure and include it as an example. As
well as a basic console system with networking.

TTYL,
Adi
