<PRE>Hiya folks, I have a few minor questions re: PWL if someone has a few 
minutes.  We're building the prototype hardware right now, and I've got 
a custom kernel (need &gt;4 serial ports, shared IRQ) built and the PWL 
filesystem onto my CF. yay!

I'm new to embedded/flash stuff, so sorry if this is basic.

1) /dev/sda1 contains the boot files, sda2 contains the OS. there's a 
sda3 partition on the rest of the CF card (128meg card), which I want to 
utilize as my own personal scratch space (this device reads from serial 
ports and stores logfiles for later upload).  Can i just make ext2 on 
/dev/sda3, and mount it in sda3/etc/fstab as hda3?  is it that simple?

sda2/etc/fstab looks like:

/dev/ram0       /               ext2    defaults
/dev/hda2       /mnt/flash      ext2    ro,noauto,defaults
none            /proc           proc    defaults

2) anyone have some quick primers on setting up the dhcpd/pump and ppp 
with this distro?  I'm sure I could noodle around and figure out what to 
put where, but it'd help if someone else had an example. ;)

3) java vm -- anyone gone through the pain and found a good one? (we're 
looking at Waba, I think)

Any other wonderful words of advice would be great, so far I'm cruising 
along with only a few hurdles.  I'm just beginning to get the hang of 
how things work in the embedded space....

oh! with CF media, can I just use dd to dump the entire card to a file, 
so I can duplicate it onto other cards? (ala a normal harddrive, block 
device, etc)

thanks!
