Ok,

I've finally got something booting off of a DOC device.  This is
awesome.  One small problem, how do I log in?  I built the kernel myself
from Redhat 6.2.  One thing I've always taken for granted is that the
RedHat installation process always asks you to provide the root
password.   Without my crutch of the Redhat install system I seem to be
at somewhat of a disadvantage.

What do I do?

thanks,

Mike

Hi,

The PeeWeeLinux logins are:

Hi,

I've been playing aroung with PWL051 lately to get embedded linux into a CF. I got the grips of it now, and I can make a linux system. If I make a ram image of the fs, and flash it into the CF (an IDE on hdc1) with rd_dialog, it works fine. However, if I want to install the fully fledged file system (not ramdisk) into the flash with the help of the "Insatall LInux LOader (LILO) to flash disk" option in pwlconfig, it comes back with the error: "Lilo not found : lilo". And consequently the flash
does not boot since the images are not there. I know lilo, as a binary is there, along with the rest of the packages (in RPM and tar).

Any hints?

Ta.

Jaime

Dr. Miro,
Looks like the path thing is getting us here.  lilo doesn't show up
on a standard path (which lilo says "no lilo in...")

The fix is to properly define the PLILO variable.

Use the standard version (RH path):
PLILO="/sbin/lilo"

-- or the copy provided in the bin directory --
PLILO="$baseprj/bin/lilo"

-- but not ---
PLILO="lilo"  # oops doesn't work :(

This was setup originally to use the patched lilo from M-Systems
which I am personally no longer using.  To finish the job, a default
assigning the variable PLILO to a user specified location should be
added.

Sorry for the confusion. Let me know if anything else doesn't quite
work as expected.
Thanks,
Ralph

Hi Ralph,

Thanks for the info. The reason for the error was, as suggested, not being able to locate lilo because I don't have /sbin on the PATH. However, setting PLILO did not help. I had to actually add it to the PATH env. variable to get it to work - I never bother doing that b4, pure laziness, always using /sbin/lilo when I was messing around with lilo :-)

With regards to other points of conflict, here is my experience in case it helps:

a) rc.sysinit not executable, but that has been raised b4 in the list. Nothing new there.

b) when the filesystem for the current project is extracted, I always get a tar error when ncurses.tar is untarred:
...
..
.
ncurses.tar   project_name/ncurses.list
tar:usr/bin/clear:Could not create file:File exists
tar:error exit delayed from previous errors
.
..
...

The file system is however untarred, and I can see the files I have selected from ncurses.tar in my root file system. It has also happened b4 that libncurses.so.X (in ncurses.tar) has not been untarred despite being selected, and I seem to remember (not sure though) being unable to log in (got the login/pwd prompt, but after properly typing the admin/admin or root/redhat login/pwd, it would give me the login prompt again :-o). Extracting the system again would not make a difference. I first
copied my own version of libncurses.so.4 from my dev. machine, and it worked. Then, I deleted the whole project filesystem, extracted it all again, and then extracted libncurses.so.X ok (also giving me the above mentioned error, though). And it all went fine after.

I'll keep you posted with my experiences. Thanks again,

Jaime

Hmmm... thought I fixed that in 0.51

This tar error only applies to usr/bin/clear which exists in another
package. That error can be safely ignored.

Hi,

What do you use for a development system? How is the flash attached to
your system?

Im actually using mandrake.. The flash device is an IDE flash device so the
bios sees it as an IDE hard drive.. I went to DJnews and found out that my
version of lilo and my boot.b map file was two diffrent version... hopefully
I can try this and it will work.. if it doesn't well i'll post another
question.. thank you for the response

Hi,

I just finished uploading PeeWeeLinux 0.52 to sourceforge. The target
build functions are now integrated into pwlconfig. The 2.2.17 kernel has
been build and a full featured kernel package is included.

Treat this carfully as the pwlconfig integration hasn't been fully tested
yet. Also, not all of the 2.2.17 kernel packages have been tested either.

Download locations are:

http://download.sourceforge.net/embedded/peeweelinux-0.52-src.tar.gz
http://download.sourceforge.net/embedded/peeweelinux-0.52-bin.tar.gz

Soon this should also be available at:

ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/distributions/peewee/

Adi

I grabbed a copy of 0.52-bin and gave it a try.  First problem I notice is
that it complains about various directories not existing.  The only one I
seem to have been affected by so far is ./Embedded_Build/rd_tmp.  Others  
already scrolled out of my scrollback buffer - sorry.

Now I'm having trouble installing a pwl system to /dev/hdd.  It is a 2Gig 
laptop hard drive.  The first problem I ran into was that the first time I
tried to "extract" the system to the hard drive, it tried to do it to
/dev/sda, even though I had already changed the device in the defaults to
/dev/hdd.  Exiting and re-starting seemed to get the change to /dev/hdd to
take.  Next, it can't seem to install lilo, but it just says 
"failed".  Here's the output:

Hi,

A big ooops on my part! I uploaded the wrong 0.52 archive. Instead of
uplaoding the working release I uploaded a previous backup with unfinished
pwlconfig scripts!

I'll try to do my best to make the 0.52 release unavailable since it
doesn't work and get a new fixed release out!

A big sorry for that one!

Hi,

You're absolutely right! The 0.52 release is proken and doesn't contain
the proper pwlconfig files.

I will update the archive and create a new fixed release asap. Also, I
will post a fix that will update the pwlconfig files for everyone who's
already downloaded the 0.52 release!

Sorry about that one!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10010180105520.16199-100000@big.adis.on.ca>

Hi,

The format of the configuration file has changed substantially between the
0.51 and 0.52 release. This is causing most of the problems with 0.52 and
the errors running pwlconfig. This should only affect anyone trying to use
an old project in 0.52.

As of 0.53 the PWL version that created the projects.default file will be
recorded. So as new variables are added to the config file PWL can make
sure that old config files are updated automatically.

PeeWeeLinux 0.53 should be ready shortly including a fix to update 0.52 to
0.53.

TTYL,
Adi

Well I got this problem solved.  It turns out that my machine is just slow.  I
started up pwl again and just let it run extracting the packages while I went
and did something else.  I came back later that night and it was finished.

Sorry for the trouble.  And thanks for the help.

PeeWeeLinux 0.53 is now available. Highlights of this
release are: 

    - Target build functions integrated into pwlconfig 
    - New 2.2.17 kernel 
    - A few bugfixes 

More details can be found in Changelog:

Hi,

Arrrghhh... They are supposed to validate uploaded tar.gz file before
moving them to the final destination. I would think the actual files
residing at metalab are corrupted then. When I compare filesizes theyre
off:

My ftp site
    peeweelinux-0.53-bin..> 18-Oct-2000 02:23  33.2M  GZIP
    peeweelinux-0.53-src..> 18-Oct-2000 03:42   164M  GZIP

    peeweelinux-0.53-src.tar.gz   141118 Kb    Thu Oct 19 08:52:00 2000

Both the source and binary package seem a few bytes short.

I will send them back up there this evening and hopefully within a couple
of days there are proper archives there.

Dean,
I was able to make this occur using the "check configuration dependancies"
feature. So the fix for this is in pwl_pkgconf (about line 643, where the
selected dependancy files are used to find the package they are contained in)

was:
   grep "$depFn" $PKG_INDEX >> .dep.add

can be fixed with:
   grep "$depFn" $PKG_INDEX | sed "s!packages\/!!g" >> .dep.add

A slight bug since PKG_INDEX contains the full path packages/xxx/fn
and package_add_delete function is expecting xxx/fn..

Hope this helps... 

Later,
Ralph

(Adi - check this out, maybe find a better way to do this; should be a variable
instead of hardcoding the "packages" path in this file - all directories are
defined in pwl_functions...)

I'm having a problem booting a 0.53 system.  It gets to where the
RAMDISK: compressed image found message is displayed, then it just starts
spitting out the following messages:

VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for swapper...
VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for kswapd...

What am I doing wrong now?

Hi,

Which kernel are you using. I've been testing the kernel-full with only
the bzImage, the 8390.o and ne.o network modules selected. It's been
booting just fine. So if you can give more detail on your set up I can try
to reproduce it.

I plan on adding an examples directory that contains prebuild projects.
One of the first additions will be a small non network configuration that
will easily fit on a floppy and build without any custom files. Somewhat
of a reference design that should load and boot to a login prompt on all
targets. That's my project for tonight...

TTYL,
Adi

I selected kernel-full, but didn't go in and change anything else under
that package group.  Perhaps I should have...

Hi,

That kernel should work. Selecting the whole package will simply consume a
lot of space but it shouldn't make any other difference.

Another problem under 0.53:  If I set my target environment to "Read-only
root fs - ext2 with no ramdisk", I get an error complaining about
"func_rd_build_ext2_only: command not found" when I attempt to load file
system onto target.  Ugh.

Hi,

The target build functions under 0.53 are still under development. The
following is the list of targets that will work. I tested them all using
4MB, 16MB and 64MB Compact Flash and Floppy (for the last option).

Compressed ramdisk on FAT 16 partition
Compressed ramdisk on ext2 partition
Uncompressed ramdisk, boot from FAT 16 partition
Uncompressed ramdisk, boot from ext2 partition
Read-only root fs with multiple ramdisks
----- Non-flash target devices -----
Compressed ramdisk on floppy disk w/o bootloader  

The other listed targets will simply refuse to do anything since the
script/function they call do not exist yet.

There'll be a pwlconfig maintanance release shortly. It adds a -b or
--experimental switch. Without it any menu options that are not completely
developed will be "turned off". Using the switch (-b or --experimental)
will show all menu options including broken features and non implemented
features.

The "Create New Project" prompt has been enhanced with a list of sample
projects that can be picked from. This should make it easier to get that
first project of the ground and a feel for pwlconfig.

Something that has potential for some grief is a change in the kernel
naming convention. I decided to not strip the kernel version from the
kernel package name. This will cause a package not found error for the
kernel package if an older project is used with the upcoming pwlconfig.
Simply pick a 'new' kernel and select the desired files to rectify the
problem.

TTYL,
Adi

Subject: Xterm
Message-ID: <39F5FEC0.5C34F0C4@amiga.com>

Ok, I've another problem that is causing me to lose hair!

I have a basic multiuser linux install up and running on a 32MByte CF
card. I am now attempting to get X running as well. Using XF86_FBDev and
fvwm2 I can get X up with an oclock onscreen in 800x600 mode on the
target hardware. What I have not been able to do is open an xterm
window. 

By not spawning the xterm, I have been able to get a failure message of
'Segmentation fault (core dumped)'. Does anyone have an idea as to why
this is happening?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10010242126080.19586-100000@big.adis.on.ca>

Hi,

Here are some updated pwlconfig scripts. Some changes:
- Non-working and under development features are no longer shown by
  default. Use 'pwlconfig -b' or 'pwlconfig --experimental' to get
  the hidden menu options
- The kernel packages no show the kernel version for clarity. This means
  older projects will not have a valid kernel until a new kernel package
  has been configured.
- Added a load example project choice to 'Create New Project' option
- Added a first example project.

Dean,
I had the same problem and never got this fixed properly.
I ended up running the system as root user - seems a 
permission problem or something.
BTW, if you go to a console, can you start xterm ?
<ctr><alt><F8>
<alt><F2>

This should give you a login prompt (if you have another
getty setup in your sysinit file ??)
login as root and type:

export DISPLAY=:0
xterm &
then press 
<alt><f7> (if you have 6 gettys setup)
--or--
<alt><f4> (if you only have 3 gettys setup, etc...)

This should start the xterm program (or at least
show some error messages that may help explain why
its not working).  Also there is a program "strace" IIRC
that prints out the system calls - capture the output from:

strace xterm 2> xxx

and see if you notice what the program is doing.

Wish I could say for sure what the problem is...if you
find out, let us know!:)

Later,
Ralph Stickley

(already lost most of my hair!)

I did this as well. I got the same Segmentation fault error.

I'll give that a try and see what I see.

I'm still working on it. My application doesn't actually require me to
run an xterm, but I hate unsolved puzzles!!! Xterm is the only
application that I've tried that actually has problems. xmag, oclock,
xload, all have been tried and work fine.

Thanks for letting me know that I'm not the only one with this problem.
I was beginning to believe that I was doing something completely stupid.

Hi,

Hmmm... PeeWeeLinux doesn't use shadow or PAM. If you get the login prompt
you would have login and mingetty. Make sure you have /var/run/utmp and
/var/log/wtmp. If you don't have those you're missing an important
package...

I am cc'ing this to the PeeWeeLinux list just in case I am missing
something here.

TTYL,
Adi
