Hi all!

To use the cliche, "I'm A Newbie" to this ML, and I hope I formulated the subject correctly...
My question is, How do I mount a cramfs volume (in this case /dev/sda2) in linux? 
I have compiled support for Compressed ROM FS as part of kernel 2.4.17 <*>. However, when i type
# mount -t cramfs /dev/sda2 /mnt/flash_p1
I continue to get the message 
mount: fs type cramfs not supported by the kernel
even though I compiled it in.

my version of mount is 
mount: mount 2.11n
(from util-linux 2.11n)

my kernel version is 2.4.17 with both romfs and cramfs support <*> compiled in.

Hi Charles,

If mount says that cramfs isn't supported by the kernel and cramfs
is absent from the list in /proc/filesystems, then it's probably
true ;)

At a guess, you may have accidentally configured the kernel to have
*modular* support for cramfs and romfs rather than building it into
the actual kernel image. Run the kernel configurator again (e.g.,
'make xconfig' in the kernel source directory) and double check
under filesystems that you selected built-in rather than modular
cramfs and romfs support. If you're using xconfig, the built-in
button is the left-most one, the middle one is for modular support.

Good luck,

I'm not sure if this is the "official" way to do this, but I've had success
with using newer kernels (2.4) in Peewee by doing the following:

1.  Build a new kernel in the usual place (/usr/src/linux), or elsewhere.
2.  Create "custom" files directory for Peewee, usually ~/custom.
3.  Copy the new kernel image (bzImage) to ~/custom/boot.
4.  Use "Configure File System" -> "Configure Custom Files" to add the
~/custom directory to your project.
5.  Remove the "kernel-basic-2.2.17" package from the project.

Hope this helps,

Mark

Message-ID: <C1256B64.0059756A.00@vzmta01.netfr.alcatel.fr>


Hi,

Does anyone's already tried to install peewee on a Rocky 328E ? It's a little
386 embedded PC board.

And I do not succed in my attempts. But it's the first time that I try to
install Peewee...

I've successfully configured my project with pwlconfig  (I hope so). And I would
like to copy this project on the embedded PC board, equipped with a floppy and
an IDE hard drive. How to do ? Copy the project on a floppy in order to load it
on the HD? I've tried this solution with this configuration of "Configure target
Hardware" :


*******************************

Target : compressed ramdisk on FAT 12 floppy disk w/syslinux
Project Mount Point : "mnt"
Project Custom Source file path : "/root/custom"
Device Mount point : "./mnt"
Boot image name : "bzImage"
Ramdisk File Name : "ramdisk"
Initrd File Name : "initrd"
Modify system boot files : "y"
----------
.
.
.
---floppy target configuration parameters-----
Floppy Device : "/mnt/floppy"
Free space on Ramdisk : "500"
.
.
.

********************

But I only obtain this message :

The target build script failed to load the filesystem onto the configured
target. Do you wish to view the results ?

And the result is : all OK except :

Testing for target device /mnt/floppy ........ failed
Testing that target /mnt/floppy is not mounted ....... failed

Does anyone could help me, please ?

Thank you.

Make sure that the target is not mounted prior to loading the file system on
to your target:

Exit Peewee, umount /mnt/floppy, and then try again.

Can you provide more information?  Details about what exactly you are trying
to do, what type of target you have (flash, diskette, etc), and any error
messages from Peewee would be helpful.

Hi,

I would like to thank you, Mark, for your help.

Since my first install attempt, I did take a special care to mount the =
floppy
before :-).

Yesterday night, I tried to install after the "umount" command, and ...=
 one of
the two "failed" message turned to "Ok".

Now I have :

Testing for target device /mnt/floppy ........ failed
Testing that target /mnt/floppy is not mounted ....... Ok

Nevertheless my floppy seems to be ok. Before "umount" it, I was able t=
o copy a
file (cp "file" /mnt/floppy/ , and "file" appears in my red hat browser=
.)

Any idea ?

Is there anybody who could explain me the difference between those 3 pa=
rameter
of the config menu :

Project Mount Point : "mnt"

Device Mount point : "./mnt"

Floppy Device : "/mnt/floppy"

And what is the mean of this parameter :

Initrd File Name : "initrd"

(Excuse me for all those "na=EFve" questions ...)

Thanks,

Guillaume PREVOST

Make sure that the target is not mounted prior to loading the file system on
to your target:

Exit Peewee, umount /mnt/floppy, and then try again.

Try changing the target to "/dev/fd0" instead of "/mnt/floppy".

I made an attempt to explain these parameters in a previous message to this
group:

http://mail.adis.on.ca/pipermail/peeweelinux/2002-January/000464.html

Hopefully this will help explain those parameters.

If anybody notices any errors in these descriptions, let me know.
Eventually, I'd like to help put together a FAQ for Peewee, and these
questions come up fairly frequently.

> And what is the mean of this parameter :

"Initrd" is the "initial ram disk image".  Initrd may be used as a
"preliminary root file system image"; this image is mounted by the kernel
prior to mounting the "real" root file system.  This is done is cases where
you need a special device driver to access the root file system, but it is
not compiled as part of the kernel.

A really good reference on this subject (and many others) is the "Linux Rute
User's Tutorial and Exposition", by Paul Sheer.  This book is available
online at: http://rute.sourceforge.net/.

Mark

Hi,

Mark, I would like to thank you very much.

I did not realy anderstood why it works with /dev/fd0 instead of /mnt/f=
loppy but
it works ...

Thus, pwlconfig creates a floppy :

bzimage   597 988 bytes
ldlinux.sys    5860 bytes
ramdisk   835247    bytes
syslinux  .cfg 82   bytes

(Hu, only 17 kbytes free on my floppy ...)

But the loading process failed :-(

During the process, I can quickly read everthing is ok except this mess=
age (or
something close to this) :

***********
Editing inittab sed : can't read .mnt/etc/inittab : Aucun fichier ou r=E9=
pertoire
de ce type
./pwlconfig : .mnt/etc/inittab : Aucun fichier ou r=E9pertoire de ce ty=
pe
***********

If you don't read french, "Aucun fichier ou r=E9pertoire de ce type" me=
ans "no
such file or directory"

At the end of le loading process, pwlconfig tell me :

"The target build script failed to load the filesystem onto the configu=
red
target"

And when I ask for the result, all seems to be ok except :

"Editing inittab : failed"

and later

"ldconfig : warning : can't open /usr/lib (no such file or directory)"

I look for /usr/lib. This directory exists with many subdirectories.
I look for inittab with "find / inittab", and it does not find it. I do=
 not have
any "etc" subdirectory in my "mnt" directory.

I try to boot my embedded PC with this floppy nevertheless.

It starts well after the Bios :

"Syslinux 1.48 1999-09-26 copyright ..." etc
"loading Ramdisk"
"loading bzimage"

And then, rapidly a lot of things that looks right until something that=
 seems to
be an endless loop :

A linux logo at the left top and a screen cover by the same message tha=
t flows
up :

"VM : do-try-to-free-pages failed for swapper"

And sometimes, a different message runs up among those : (It is not eas=
y to
read, it could be something a little bit close to this)

"VM : do-try-to-free-pages failed for kswaped"

This process stops after a "ctrl-alt-suppr". And I can reboot my embedd=
ed PC
without the floppy, DOS restarts well (DOS was installed on the HD befo=
re, but I
would like to crush it with peewee).

Does the process try to install peewee on my HD ? (my floppy driver is =
noisier
than my HD driver)

Does anybody have any idea ?

The lack of inittab may be the cause ? What is inittab and how to make =
it appear
? Why my /mnt/etc/ directory does not existe ?

Many thanks.

Try changing the target to "/dev/fd0" instead of "/mnt/floppy".

I made an attempt to explain these parameters in a previous message to this
group:

http://mail.adis.on.ca/pipermail/peeweelinux/2002-January/000464.html

Hopefully this will help explain those parameters.

If anybody notices any errors in these descriptions, let me know.
Eventually, I'd like to help put together a FAQ for Peewee, and these
questions come up fairly frequently.

> And what is the mean of this parameter :

> Initrd File Name : "initrd"

"Initrd" is the "initial ram disk image".  Initrd may be used as a
"preliminary root file system image"; this image is mounted by the kernel
prior to mounting the "real" root file system.  This is done is cases where
you need a special device driver to access the root file system, but it is
not compiled as part of the kernel.

A really good reference on this subject (and many others) is the "Linux Rute
User's Tutorial and Exposition", by Paul Sheer.  This book is available
online at: http://rute.sourceforge.net/.

Regards,

Mark

Hi,
My name is Shawn Perkins and I seem to be having problems with my
Ethernet port on my advantech single board computer. Using pwlconfig, I
rebuilt the kernel with the appropriate Ethernet driver, configured the
system, and downloaded the whole ball of wax to my flash card. The
system boots up and when I try to configure eth0 (ifconfig eth0
192.168.1.1) I get a message saying no such device. I do notice when the
kernel is booting it configures a device called 'brg0' this can be
configured with an IP, but does not seem to work for passing traffic.
Does anyone have some ideas, it's probably something very simple I'm
overlooking. I believe the onboard Ethernet chip is made by Realtek.
 
Also, on to a different topic, has anyone been able to get the Linksys
USB 100M to work with PeeWee? It's a USB Ethernet adapter, and I believe
it's using the Pegasus chipset. Once I get the onboard Ethernet to work,
I'm going to attempt to get this guy up and running. Wish me luck :-)
 
Thanks for your help,
Shawn

Hi,

Did you include the network driver as module? If so, are you loading the 
module before configuring IP?

Adi,
I selected the driver when I built the kernel. It was selected as an
asterisk and not an M. I don't know a lot about the loadable modules, is
there an additional step I would need to take?

Hi,

Is the network card you're trying to get to work ISA or PCI? If it is ISA 
or if the drivers requires parameters, they will have to be passed to the 
kernel at boot. If it's a loadable mdule the paramters are passed to the 
driver when the module is loaded.

If you're building modules, you have to load the module using modprobe or 
insmod. I believe the initscrips include support for /etc/rc.module which 
would be the place for all your insmod statement if you're using kernel 
modules.

Hi Guillaume,

I'm glad that things are working better now.  Keep in mind that /mnt/floppy is simply an
arbitrary "mount point", but /dev/fd0 is actually the device entry for your floppy drive.

> Editing inittab sed : can't read .mnt/etc/inittab : Aucun fichier ou répertoire de ce
type

Check to make sure that you have selected "etc/" under Project File System --> System
Base --> file system, and also "etc/inittab" under initscripts.  You may have selected
another package (sysvinit, for example) that requires this file.

I might be a good idea to use the default set of options for the "minimal" project
initially, make sure everything works, and then add or delete packages as needed.

> Does the process try to install peewee on my HD ? (my floppy driver is noisier than my
HD driver)

If you're using "/dev/fd0" as the target, peewee is trying to install to the floppy.  The
entire target filesystem is created on the HD prior to installation on the target.

Mark

Hi All,
Can someone help me
First i am not very good at Linux, installing it is about it for me :-)
I have a project to build a wireless router with a advantec 5820 sbc
it has a pc104 pcmcia card and a 20 meg sandisk it also has
RTL8139(A/B/BL/C/8130) PCI/Cardbus Fast Ethernet NIC onboard network card
the wireless card is a Orinoco silver.
i have played with peewee and got the system to boot but it has no pcmcia or
wireless drivers loaded
I have looked at the wireless isa project but it will not work and i can not
seem to get my head around the build system. :-(
Can one of you Gurus help me out with either some code or step by step
instructions

Hi all,

I don't check yet parameters you give to me in your last mail, Mark. I think I
will have time to do this evening.

But  there is a detail that I don't understand in documentations I have seen :

You write :

If you're using "/dev/fd0" as the target, peewee is trying to install to the
floppy. The
entire target filesystem is created on the HD prior to installation on the
target.

But my aim is to install Peewee on the HD of my embedded PC. I have created the
target filesystem on the HD of my Desk PC with Red Hat (or I think so). And I
only use a floppy as a link between my desk PC HD and my embedded PC HD. Is
there any other way to do ? I could also try to temporarily install my embedded
PC HD on my desk PC as primary slave disk ...

By using a floppy to transfer data, when I choose a target in pwlconfig, this
target is not directly accessible from pwlconfig. Is it possible ? I think that
it is, because I imagine that you may have to use this way to install peewee on
a diskonchip. But this does not appear clearly to me in documentations.

Thank you.

Hi Guillaume,

but

I'm glad that things are working better now.  Keep in mind that /mnt/floppy is
simply an
arbitrary "mount point", but /dev/fd0 is actually the device entry for your
floppy drive.

> Editing inittab sed : can't read .mnt/etc/inittab : Aucun fichier ou
répertoire de ce
type

Check to make sure that you have selected "etc/" under Project File System -->
System
Base --> file system, and also "etc/inittab" under initscripts.  You may have
selected
another package (sysvinit, for example) that requires this file.

I might be a good idea to use the default set of options for the "minimal"
project
initially, make sure everything works, and then add or delete packages as
needed.

> Does the process try to install peewee on my HD ? (my floppy driver is noisier
than my
HD driver)

If you're using "/dev/fd0" as the target, peewee is trying to install to the
floppy.  The
entire target filesystem is created on the HD prior to installation on the
target.

Regards,

Mark

Peewee configures everything based on your target, so in this case you end up with a
bootable floppy.  Simply copying everything from the floppy to your hard drive will not
result in a bootable hard drive.

As an example, I use Peewee to configure a bootable 8MB DiskOnChip.  The DOC is installed
in my development PC while running Peewee; the part is then removed and placed in the
embedded target when Peewee is done.

In your case, installing the hard drive as a primary slave is probably the way to go.
Your target device would then be "/dev/hdb", assuming you have IDE drives.  Since you are
no longer limited by the size of a floppy, this will also give you much more space to add
additional packages as needed.

Regards,

Mark

Hi,

You can use a VMware based RedHat 6.2 system to develop and configure 
systems. With VMware 3.x you can also load a target using a USB attached 
CF reader. 

I've had problems running boot floppies in VMware, don't remember why.

Hi All... 

Does anyone know where "the directions" as quoted in the boot results section? are? I'm using busybox's init services (i believe)

I have kinda figured out that the first section before the first : Is the device to send output to? I can put /bin/bash in instead of a mingetty call and it works.. I put ttyS0 in instead of 1 2 3 4 or 5. 

Maybe this whole thing is caused by conflicting settings in ./pwlconfig.. does busybox provide sysvinit as configured by peewee?

boot results as follows:
Freeing unused kernel memory: 72k freed
serial console detected.  Disabling virtual terminals.
Bad inittab entry: id:3:initdefault:
device '/dev/si' does not exist.  Did you read the directions?
Bad inittab entry: si::sysinit:/rc.init

Hi,

Has anyone created any packages for PeeWeeLinux?

I am working on some updated and new packages. Back when I had choosen rpm
as a package maintenance tool. I don't remember why. The pwlconfig
scripts deal entirely with tar files. The only time rpm comes into play
is when the rpm files are extracted into tar files.

I wonder if it would be easier to do away with rpm and use shell scripts
to generate PeeWeeLinux packages?

Any suggestions?

Adi

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0202270034020.16233-100000@big.adis.on.ca>

Hi,

This is just a minor update. Pwlconfig relies on the lxdialog binary to
create and display its graphical interface. The lxdialog supplied with pre
0.61.1 version was dynamically linked and doesn't work out of the box with
some Linux distribution, notably distributions newer than RedHat 6.2.

This release included a copy of the lxdialog sources from the kernel
source tree. The lxdialog binary is no build the first time pwlconfig is
run on a system. This makes PeeWeeLinux easier to use on Linux installs
with ncurses5.

If you have a working 0.61.0 install, there won't be any benefit in
upgrading to 0.61.1!

Regards,
Adi

Yes.

I accutualy use vmware to build and test the target this way: I have an 
RH 6.2 with PeeWee installed on a vmware session. In this sesstion I 
created a small virtual ide drive - my target. To test I just run 
another vmware session using the virtual drive I created and populated 
with peewee as boot device.

I think you should keep this way as RPMs are a good way to get already

I second that.  I've pulled in several rpm's from others to use on our
peewee project and it was very easy to do it that way.

I second that.  I've pulled in several rpm's from others to use on our
peewee project and it was very easy to do it that way.

Me Too.

The ability to pull in a (an?) source rpm that contains tools that you 
need, and have it rebuild with little to no effort is a very attractive 
feature in peewee.
Not to say that it can't be done with tarballs and shell scripts, it just 
seems to me that all the extra work of creating source 
maintenance/compilation scripts would be a waste of time when rpm is doing 
the job nicely as it is :) (IMHO)

Kind Regards, 

Delaney.
