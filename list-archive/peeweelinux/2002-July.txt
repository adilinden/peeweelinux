hello again,

I have another problem which isnt quite peewees fault.


With my distribution i have a perl/Tk script run as soon as you log in.
 
the script runs fine. the problem i am having is when the script starts up 
(its a dialogue box) it will only come into focus when i click the mouse 
button on some position on the screen.
 
what i want the script to do is to startup and come into focus in the middle 
of the screen with no mouse clicking and for it to be locked into that 
posisition so that people cant then move it around the screen because for 
some reason when that happens the dialogue doesnt want to refresh so you have 
to use twm to restart the script.
 
so anyone know how to:
 
a) make the script appear in focus and locked to the middle of the screen? or
 b) if you cant lock it then how to make the screen refresh when its moved so 
i dont have to restart the app all the time?

thanks
Justin

looks fine. what's your error ? did you notice if the servers are installed,
or if they are in individual packages ?

one thing I noticed was the X symlink is not created, so try to run the
XServer with XFree86_SVGA (for example, if you use this server)

can you get it working calling the binary directly ?
do you have XFS running ?
do you have libm ? if not, perhaps you're missing packages, it's easy
finding out which, with the peewee gui

Those are correct packages.  have you also included the X libraries?


If you are trying to make it work using startx thats different.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] X windows system problem.www.lin
Message-ID: <sd2ab0cb.053@qatech.com>

Hello,

I have an embedded system using peewee and X. I want a GUI to fire up (a statically linked gtk app) when I boot the PC and stay there in focus all the time without anyone being able to "send it to the background". This sounds very familiar with your application. 

What I do is in the default runlevel I SU to a certain user, say autoboot for nomenclature. In the autoboot users bash profile, I have a command for startx. Then I put a .xinitrc file in the users directory so that that gets used instead of the default system xinit script. In short it looks like this:

#/home/autoboot/.profile
~./bashrc

#/home/autoboot/.bashrc
/usr/X11R6/bin/startx

#/home/autoboot/.xinitrc
/usr/bin/YourXAppToRun

Make sure that all the paths are right of course. For the .xinitrc file I copied the one that came with Peewee and then modified by removing all calls to xterm and xclock and other programs (including window manager) and just inserted a call to my app. Everything works fine for me, I never loose focus and since it is the only app I need to run everythign is fine. 

What I have in this example is basically a generic autobooting X server for VGA16 (why can't every video card just support VESA standard VGA256!!) You could replace my app with any app you want, so I was wondering if anyone would want to have an example of my project after its been genericized. Let me know if anyone is interested.

I do this in a different manner, I edit a runlevel (usually 4), and add a
service(my application). I guess both are good ways to do it.

In this example I need to log in a user and then fire up an X session. I guess you could do this in a service also by su to user and then run X and application, but using the user facilities seems to work good in this case for me.

I've made some progress.  Here's what I've done so far:

1) Created the /etc/X11/XF86Config file
2) Link XF86_SVGA -> X
3) Added libm and libdl libraries

It now makes some progess starting with startx but dies with:
FontTransSocketUNIXConnect : can't connect : errno = 111
Failed to set default font path 'unix:7100'
could not open default font 'fixed'

I assume this means that I'm either missing a required font or I need to
change the FontPath in the XF86Config to "unix:-1"?

Another update - sorry to bother people with this, but maybe my experience
will help someone out in the future.

I fixed the font issue by changing the FontPath entry in XF86Config to read:

FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/"

I then found I needed to add libncurses.

Now startx gets further, draws the desktop and then dies with "xterm: no
available ptys".

Ok, success!  I just needed to at the pty entries in the "Configure Project
File System" menu and it works.

Just to recap, required steps:

1) Created the /etc/X11/XF86Config file with FontPath set to the following:
    FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
    FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
    FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/"

2) Link XF86_SVGA -> X

3) Added libm, libdl, libncurses libraries

4) Added necessary ptys in /dev

the pty problem is not a pty problem, but another missing xfree86 package. I cant remember which one it was, but I remember the package description was somehting I originally thought I didn't need.

it means you are not running xfs (X font server).

there is a peewee package for xfs, you have to select it, it will run out of
the box.

I've made some progress.  Here's what I've done so far:

1) Created the /etc/X11/XF86Config file
2) Link XF86_SVGA -> X
3) Added libm and libdl libraries

It now makes some progess starting with startx but dies with:
FontTransSocketUNIXConnect : can't connect : errno = 111
Failed to set default font path 'unix:7100'
could not open default font 'fixed'

I assume this means that I'm either missing a required font or I need to
change the FontPath in the XF86Config to "unix:-1"?

I actually did have the xfs package added.  I guess it isn't starting for
some reason (do I need another package for starting it?) or I had the wrong
port (7100 instead of -1?).  As you may have seen  from my other email, I
was able to make it work without running xfs by putting in file paths in the
FontPath entries in XF86Config.

Message-ID: <3D2F14FC.1030708@alumni.cwru.edu>

ok, ive managed to build the minimal example, and boot the floppy.
impressively easy!  my next task is to move the minimal example to
a different box (i.e. i want to develop on one system and target
another...  im sure plenty of you do that).  the ./pwlconfig script
doesnt seem to offer any way of simply "packaging" all of the files
necessary to do this.  or am i missing something?  can someone point
me in _a_ direction to figure out what i havent learned yet...

thanks!

I believe you just want to install the networking (FTP, Telnet) in order to do remote development?? If so I think it is pretty much setup for you. I haven't done this myself though.

Hi,

I am running peewee on a small thin-client machine.  All parts on the board 
inside, apart from the flash card are static.  This includes:

300Mhz cpu, 16meg ram.

X comprises of XDM as the display manager and TWM as the windows manager, 
both of which come with peewee.

The flash card is a 16meg flash card so as you can see the setup is small.

The problem I am having is I am using a perl/Tk gui program that loads up in 
X at start up (nothing else just he gui) and if i move that gui around the 
inside of the window doesnt refresh and gets all distorted and even opaque.  
You might say just dont enable the window to be moved: it doesnt make any 
odds, i run rdesktop and when it connects to the terminal server if you move 
the windows around in there they also get distorted.

Something that might be worth mentioning is the background icons do not get 
distorted when moving a window over them, are they getting refreshed?

If i start up X without starting up the gui and run a Xterm window instead 
and run the gui from that, the distortion doesnt happen.

I am getting to my wits end with this i could REALLY use some help and/or 
ideas here.  I think its a memory issue, as all the memory is taken up when 
expanding the ramdisk.

Ideas would be VERY much appreaciated
Regards
Justin

Hi,

	I've read some posts on the mailing list claiming that peewee doesn't have
an ftp server. Actually now that I need one, I can't find it. I can find the
ftp client, but no server (the line exists in inetd, but no binary). I
imagine I can get the ftpd rpm from redhat 6.1 and put it in RPMs, but it's
such a basic package...

	Do I need to download any extra packages ?

	I was configuring peewee tonight for java, so I'll send you the list of
file tomorrow (like I told you on a previous mail).

	Also, I have some other questions :

	- is any way to sync time included in peewee ? perhaps msntp ?
	- if I want to mount another partition at boot do I have do supply a fstab
and select the option to replace boot files ? will this impact my rc.init ?
(asking because of the help text)
	- I have a rw partition, and would like to make it ext3 or reiser, for
obvious reasons. can I do this in peewee ? was any of these even suported on
2.x kernels ?

thanks

Message-ID: <000101c22e52$4cc155d0$0100007f@ricardo>

Hi,

	while trying to get ftp working on peewee, I  downloaded wu-ftpd for RH6.1
on rpmfind.

	it complains about libpam. I can't also use su because of libpam. I imagine
I'm missing somethig, because su comes with peewee and also doesn't work.
any ideas ?

	I also have a question about telnetd, it's very slow. I was told it has to
do with reverse lookup, so I'm not sure if the problem is only peewee
related... does it happen to anyone else ?

thanks
Ricardo

Dont know about the FTP server,

For reiser, just compile the latest stable 2.4.xx and put it in custom/boot/bzImage. Its really quite easy that way and then you have complete control over your kernel. I prefer this also because I can compile in my ethernet driver and not deal with modules.

Hi,

There was supposed to have been an ftp server for PeeWeeLinux. Not sure 
when it disapeared but it is not in 0.60 or 0.61.

PeeWeeLinux does not need pam. In order to get a ftp server to work it has 
to be compiled on RH6.2 without pam. Unfortunatley I don't have a working 
build environment right now, so I can't just build an rpm to include. I am 
working on the next version of PeeWeeLinux that comes with its own build 
environment and should work independent of the Linux distribution it's 
been installed on.

I believe msntp is a simple ntp client but I haven't used it in ages...

ok, thanks, I'll try to find an RPM for ftpd.

maybe I'll ask on the list and you can put it in your ftp server ? I've seen
on the list that it's a fairly regular question...

Hi Ricardo,

A generic RedHat rpm will not likely work for PWL. They will all have PAM 
support if they were properly build. I'd recommend building one all static 
or using RedHat 6.2 but disabling PAM.

Hi Ricardo,

I have wu-2.6.1ftpd running on Peewee.  I compiled this from scratch a few 
months back; the executable is about 147k bytes.

I don't have an RPM for it -- I just placed ftpd and ftpaccess in the proper 
custom files directories.  If this does you any good, let me know and I can 
send you the files.

Hi Guys,

This is what I have done,
I grabbed an ftpd rpm (version from Mandrake 8.1 I think but it doesn't
matter)
and just included the pam.permit.so (?) library, and basically used  a pam
config file to set all pw checking to optional,
and took root out of the ftpusers - this will not work for everyone, for
example root can ftp in without a password but in the environment that we
are deploying peewee on this is not an issue.

Kind Regards,
Delaney

Subject: [Peeweelinux] New
Message-ID: <2.2.16.20020718181318.8adfc6f4@zmicro.com>

After surveying many "embedded" linux packages, I have decided 
to give PeeWee a try.  I am happy to see that there is some
activity.  From the looks of things, I didn't expect much.

So far the docs look so old that even I may be able to help.  I
think a few lines on "getting started" would help.  We certainly 
have an opportunity to get a "first-timer's" perspective.

I downloaded the ISO image for the cd and burned that, thinking I
would find both the source and binary packages there.  The unpacking
instructions tell us, "tar -xzf embedded-0.18-src.tar.gz to extract
the source release, or tar -xzf embedded-0.18-src.tar.gz to extract
the binary release."   There isn't anything called embedded on the
this disk.  There aren't any tar.gz files on the disk (except the
three in /bin/src).  The files are referred to as 0.18, the doc
is 0.19, but the current release is 0.61   This makes me suspect
that both the names and the packaging method may have changed.

I'm off to the mirror site to look for a separate tarball for 
the binary system, and I hope to have this all figured out shortly.
If I'm not successful, I'll be back with questions.   I hope I'm
not the first new guy since 0.19 :)   

This ought to be fun...

Barry

Hello Barry,

I am relatively new to peewee and I have found it very useful. I also thought that the documentation was a bit dated when I first started, so it could use some updating that I am sure would be appreciated. I trust you'll find peewee linux very simple, powerful, and flexible after using it a couple times.

In the following messages I will reveal answers to questions 
that might be posed by someone starting out cold.  By the time
I get through this, I'll no longer qualify :)

Getting PeeWee

After going to SourceForge and downloading the binary package,
and untarring it to a suitable directory tree, I discovered
a few things.

   - It looks just like the directory tree on the CD
   - It has one bad symlink to SRPMS
   - There's a script in the top directory called cd_install

Sure enough, the difference between the CD and the binary package
is the presence of the SRPMS.  In the binary package the SRPMS
are removed.  I ran the cd_install script, and (after following
the directions to become root) let it remove what I had untarred
and, near as I can tell, it then copied the same things back
to that directory (plus the sources).

So for first-time obtainers, the images found on SourceForge
are as follows:

old name: embedded-0.18-src.tar.gz
   If you look back through the versions, you will find that the
   name changed between versions 0.32 and 0.40

CD image: peeweelinux-0.61.1.iso
   Burn this to a CD and everything described below is there.

Source package: peeweelinux-0.61.1-src.tar.gz
  Untar this and get the same thing that you see on the CD.
  Includes, source, binary, and configuration.

Binary package: peeweelinux-0.61.1-bin.tar.gz
  Untar this and get the CD image, except the source tree
  from src/SRPMS is not present.

Configuration tool:
  This is just the pwlconfig scripts and utilities found
  in the bin, scripts, and lxdialog directories. 



Corrections are solicited.  

Next: Installing ('Unpack')

After that: Making a system (hint--I need help: I couldn't
  find "boot_system"; and the unmodified "minimal" image
  didn't fit on a floppy.)

See y'all next week.

Hi,

	Is there a way to customize the little tux image that shows when peewee
boots.

	Last time I checked it was hard-coded in the kernel. is it still like that
or can it be changed ?

thanks

Afaik, it is still hardcoded in the kernel, but it is easy to change it. 

I followed the steps in bulmalug.net/impresion.phtml?nIdNoticia=1071, but
this page is in spanish.  It is really easy.  If you don't speak spanish let
me know and I will make a short summary.

There is another page I found but I haven't tested:
www.arnor.net/linuxlogo/download.html 

I hope this helps you.

#define PWL PeeWeeLinux

As I said in my last post, I'm relating my experiences as I learn
how to get PWL up and running.  Corrections are welcome and maybe
some of this can be used to improve the documentation.

(Unless PWL is so simple it needs no documentation :)

Installing PeeWeeLinux 

(2.1 -- Download)
URL's are fairly fragile; links change often.  Happily, 
when you get to the SourceForge page, you only need
to type "peeweelinux" into the search box and you will be
taken right to it.  (In this case SourceForge has changed
the link "filelist.php" to "showfiles.php")
 
Select "files" and see my previous post for what to download.

(2.2 -- Unpack)

The doc is out of date and has an error besides.  The name of
the distribution changed so it's no longer called "embedded-"
rather it's "peeweelinux-".  Also the doc specifies the same name
for source and binary, but file you want will have "src" or
"bin" in the name.

Use the cd_install script (this is explained in the file INSTALL)
It's the same as untarring the file, but it checks a few extra
things such as a pre-existing package tree, and whether you 
have root privileges.



--
I suspect the CHANGELOG file also gives some enlightenment, but I
usually avoid reading that because as a first-time user, I'm
not really interested in what's been fixed or improved.  
Nonetheless, it's a good place to look when updating 
the documentation.

In part III we start running things.

Barry

By posting these writeups, I won't lose them :)

3. pwlconfig

The first time you try pwlconfig,  you may get some errors,
followed by:
 Utility program "lxdialog" not found
 ( From (RH) /usr/src/linux type make Menuconfig
    then cp /usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog/lxdialog to ./bin)

What's happened is that lxdialog is (apparently) a utility that's
built by Linux's kernel-compile "make config" utility. The first
time you use it to configure a kernel, it discovers there's no
such thing, so it builds one!  After that, it just runs it (where
it must be lxdialog, no?) whenever you come back to change 
something.  Anyway, if you follow the directions, all will
be well, and you can proceed with pwlconfig.

One error, though; Menuconfig should be menuconfig, and yes, it
knows the difference.

Note that this is all going on in your host system, and not
in the PWL package.  But when you copy the result, that
does go to ./bin, namely Embedded_Build/bin in your PWL tree.

3.1.2 pwlconfig
The first time pwlconfig is run, it will build a few things
of its own!

The first time I ran pwlconfig I was taken to:

"Create new project".  After choosing a name I got:

	No tar packages were found. Do you wish to extraxt 
	 all binary rpms and create tar packages now
	 (recommended)?

(typo there, in 'extraxt')
After answering yes, rpm's found in ./src/RPMS/i386/ are extracted and
placed in ./packages/    This uses about 80MB.

Now we're ready to use the system.  Next I go to "Configure Project 
File System" as directed.

Here's where I get into trouble.   I'm supposed to see "boot_system"
but it's just not there.   Things must have changed quite a bit
since then.   But since everything is probably "as needed" and I
expect it won't let me build an empty system, I decide to 
forge ahead to the "go back to main menu" part and select "Extract 
File System from Project".   I ought to get something pretty 
small, or a warning like "pick a kernel, stupid!"

So I choose:
  Load File System onto Target /dev/fd0

I'm not successful.

 * * * 

At this point I am going in about 5 different directions.  I have
tried to create a new project and build it; I have copied an
existing one and built it; each time I'm thinking I may get
a bootable system, useful or not.   Each time I get errors...
Now, the first time, it claimed it wouldn't all fit on the
floppy.  But successive tries haven't produced that, so I
will let that go until it comes up again.  More to the point
I get problems like no  /etc/ld.so.conf or /etc/ld.so.cache,
can't stat /lib or /usr/lib, ...

I think this is where my careful note-taking ends.

So I expect that tomorrow I'll be back with more specific 
questions, like do I need to select a kernel, and is there
any interaction between the target kernel and the one on
the host (all this talk about libs and configs).

And then I can think about adding packages.

I'm getting there.

Which PeeWeeLinux version are you trying? The latest release includes the
lxdialog sources and automatically builds lxdialog the first time
pwlconfig is run.

I'm using 0.61.1, just downloaded from SourceForge.  It did not
build automatically, and I'd be willing to find out why, if it
would help improve the script.  This was tried on two different 
computers using RH 7.3

Interesting, the sources for lxdialog should reside in 
"Embedded_Build/lxdialog" and the build section for lxdialog is in 
"Embedded_Build/scripts/pwl_functions".

I found it already.

I realized that this did not occur on the second installation. I
was too busy with my notes from the previous try, to notice.  So
I will have to change my writeup, because the second comment 
about "pwlconfig will automatically build some stuff of its own"
was in fact, lxdialog being built.

The difference was this:  When I first started out, I was trying
not to be root.   Everyone advises me to stay out of root as
much as possible.  Problem is, everything I'm interested in 
doing requires root privileges!   

As for the script, it apparently looks for lxdialog to be built
before it checks to see if you are root.   So a non-root user
will get the error and the build instructions as I did.

Hello everyone,
Due to the lack of current documentation, I have a few questions. I'm a new 
PeeWeeLinux user, and so far, it has helped me tremendously. I have an embedded 
device using a compactflash as the harddrive. I have easily created a system on 
flash using a USB flash reader to setup the boot system, which successfully boots my 
device. 

Now, for my questions:
1. I would like a read-only root filesystem on one partition, and a read-write 
filesystem on a second partition. The second partition will store config files, log 
files between power cycles of the embedded device. Since PeeWeeLinux seems to re-
partition the device each time I load the system, what is the best way to maintain 
two partitions?

1a. Does anyone have any suggestions on the best way to use a read-write partition? 
For example, the ramdisk is great because I can power down my embedded device 
without worrying about corrupting the root filesystem. I do need to maintain config 
files and log files which change during the operation of my device, so obviously, I 
need a method to store this information between power cycles. Hence, a read-write 
partition. It would be nice, however, to not have to worry about corrupting the read-
write partition if a user just hits the power button. Any suggestions or best 
practices from anyone here?? Perhaps there is a way to write all config files as 
power loss is detected? I seem to recall reading something about some devices which 
maintain power just long enough to store config files. Does anyone have any 
knowledge in this area?

2. Is there any documentation on how to use the custom features of PeeWeeLinux? I 
have custom applications which need to be included, plus I will obviously be 
modifying system scripts, etc. Ultimately, I want an image that I can easily load 
onto a new flash disk without any further configuration once my initial system is 
built.

3. In the same regard, certain config files need to be updated during operation of 
my device. (ex. network ip address, etc). I would expect a user to have the ability 
to modify the ip address while the device is running. I would also like to maintain 
these changes after a power-cycle. With a ramdisk, this is not possible. Any 
suggestions? If i can get a read-write partition to work, I could probably modify 
the load scripts to mount the partition and read the network config files from 
there. Any thoughts?

These are just initial questions as I dig into PeeWeeLinux. Any suggestions you have 
would be greatly appreciated. I will dig into the setup scripts and perhaps make 
some modifications to suit my purpose. However, I don't want to change too much as 
it will create problems as new versions of PeeWeeLinux are created.

Thanks in advance for all your help.

It's official: I'm confused.

I decided to start where I left off, running pwlconfig and
using the current project again.  So I start with trying
to write the target image, same as before.

This time, it worked.

Time to start exploring configurations.  Like, where the root

The root password is 'redhat'. You can change password if you include the 
appropriate files in your project or you can include a custom 
'/etc/passwd' using custom files.

Hello Stefan,

I have similar requests as yours regarding filesystem. The option for creating multiple uncompressed partitions is the closest to what you are asking for. 

The uncompressed Read only option gets you stability and ability to shut off power without hurting your file system. It ends up creating two RO partitions, one for boot and one for root I think?? But the third partition is the remaining disk space. It does not get a filesystem on it, so you have to do a mkfs on it manually, if I recall correctly. 

As far as changing parameters with a script or program, simply isse a "mount -o remount  -rw"   (syntax correct??) kind of command and you can modify your config files. Just make sure to remount ar RO once you are done so that the user doesn't trash the filesystem.

I solved this one by upgrading to kernel 2.4.18 (see my howto in 
previous list archives), and then using ext3 as the filesystem for the 
3rd "leftover" partition as (mounted as /opt on boot).  Here's a small 
script I use that makes/populates /dev/sda3 after PWL rebuilds the flash 
card:

   #!/bin/sh

   echo "Creating filesystem..."
   mke2fs -j -b 1024 -m0 /dev/sda3

   echo "Populating filesystem..."
   mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 /mnt/usbdev
   cp -a /usr/local/pwl/Embedded_Build/opt_tree/* /mnt/usbdev/

   echo "Syncing and unmounting..."
   sync
   umount /mnt/usbdev

So, of course, this requires you keep the "master" /opt tree on your 
build machine.  Couple this ext3 filesystem with a SanDisk industrial 
grade CF disk, and you're set.  I've had nothing but good luck with ext3 
recovers.

Besides my /opt dealio above, I just make custom .tar files that mimic

Thanks everyone for your wonderful input. I've been digging into PWL and learning 
how things work. I've already managed to configure my embedded system, loaded my 
custom application, and it runs! YEAH!!!!!! (minus a few configuration issues)

With that, and all your suggestions, I'll have this thing flying in no time. In case 
anyone cares, for those doing research, I'm using an Advantech PCM-5820 Biscuit 
board with a CompactFlash disk. Advantech doesn't support linux, but the hardware is 
generic, and so far everything is working great. 

On a side note...before discovering PWL, I attempted to create my own distribution. 
While possible...all i can really say about the experience is AAARRRRGGGHHHHH!!! A 
few more months and I may have had it. PWL saved me tons of time.

A Big Thanks to the creators of PWL!!!!

Thanks again for all your help.

Its easy, you will of course need framebuffering and then you download the 
linux logo plugin for the Gimp:

Its quite easy to use just follow the instructions.

1) I have that setup. on the partition that peewee leaves empty I make a fs,
include a custom fstab (don't forget to configure the option to modify
system files), it gets mounted on boot. of course if you load the image to
the CF again that partition is lost. I don't find that's a problem, once you
have your distribution stable you probably won't mind that anymore.

1a) the only solution (that I know of) that's good there is a journalling
FS. One of this days I'm going to try ext3 on peewee, but I think you'll
need to upgrade the kernel. I don't think the solution you mentioned
(writing config on powerdown) is "production quality", because it depends on
your hardware, and linux is not a realtime OS... (I can be wrong of course).

3) the custom feature of peewee is very nice, I think it's easy to use. play
with it a little, I think you'll get the touch. check the directories under
your project to understand what it does to files. When I want to change IP,
I mount the CF on the /mnt/flash mountpoint supplied, change the IP or
upgrade the app, unmount and reboot.

regarding new versions, Adi is working on a new and improved peewee, so I
think this version is the last of it's kind (correct me please Adi).

It's a pitty, because a lot of people were getting used to it, but Adi says
it was getting harder to maintain due to redhat dependencies.

good luck
bye

	But I'm having a little problem with Netscape because, it is not accepting

copy the .netscape dir to the home of netscapeUser .

su netscapeUser -c "netscape -no-spl....-geom...0+0"

but the su implementation in busybox don't support this sintaxis (-c string

If anyone have other solution or idea, please let me know, thanks again !!

Actually, if you're only using the binary distribution nothing should 
change at all.

The source version will be different, though. You should only notice the 
differece if you're compiling your own rpms. The PeeWeeLinux we have now, 
required a host Linux system with libs that match PeeWeeLinux, essentially 
RedHat 6.2. What I plan on doing is a dedicated build environment that you 
chroot into to build PeeWeeLinux. This will ensure only the libs actually 
included and distributed with PeeWeeLinux will be available. This will 
also make rpm spec files easier to maintain since I no longer have to jump 
through hops to exclude standard RedHat libs which are not part of 
PeeWeeLinux (pam, etc).

So most of the changes to the new and improved PeeWeeLinux will be behind 
the scenes.

Now that I have a pretty firm grasp (and many notes) on what and how I 
like to do it I just have to get the time to actually make it happen...

We are also using an Advantech system, a PCM-3350 mainboard with a 
PCM-3643-04A1 4port serial attached, and finally a PCM-3601 modem card 
plugged on as well.  All pieces play very well with PWL, nary a problem 
as far as hardware is concerned. (we don't use the vga/usb/lpt at all tho)

If this helps, Netscape stores the info of whether or not you accepted 
the license agreement in a file called "registry" in the .netscape/ 
directory.  Perhaps you need to tarball up an already accepted copy of 
one of those?  *shrug*

Hello Adi,

Not to get into a great discussion about development, but does the new version of peewee being built in this chroot fashion allow for easier updates (and additional) libraries. I.e. can glibc be updated easily? Right now I am statically building my GTK app.

Hi Ken,

If glibc was updated it would certainly require all other rpms to be 
rebuilt as well. My goal is to have scripts that would allow one to build 
the development environment and all rpms from scratch with, a single 
command. 

To replace glibc you would have to make changes to the glib.spec file and 
then build PeeWeeLinux from scratch. This will mean dealing with any 
problems that surface due to the changed glibc during the build of any 
other packages.

Adi

I sounds like a lot of people are using Advantech systems with this.  I've
been using the Advantech PCM-5822.  In regards to the issue of Advantech
supporting Linux, although their website has minimal info regarding Linux, I
was quite surprised to find that the CD-ROM that comes with product has a
lot of Linux info including both the binary and source for the elusive
official "Durango" XFree86 driver written by National Semi which is
virtually impossible to find online.  I've had the 5822 for about a month
now and could have saved quite a bit of time for myself if I'd actually
looked on the Advantech CD-ROM first, but I'm used to vendor-supplied
drivers being useless.  Note that this is a an Xfree86 3.x driver - Xfree86
4.x users should probably stick to the standard VESA driver for best
results.

Adi,

I'm glad to hear that a new version is in the works.  Is there any chance
that Troy's kernel 2.4.18 support will be rolled in?

Thanks.  On reflection, I think that it might simply be a question of making
it easier to figure out which packages go with which kernel versions.  When
I used Troy's approach to work with kernel 2.4.18 the biggest issue was
figuring out which packages would work as is and which needed to be rebuilt.
Maybe it's just a documentation issue and if people on the list who are
using custom 2.4 kernels can simply post here which packages they had to
rebuild then it might not require any real changes to PWL itself.

Thanks

Ed

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Fits on a floppy?
Message-ID: <2.2.16.20020724164748.65e73f30@zmicro.com>

I've been trying the "load system onto /dev/fd0" thing here and I
find that 
 (1) It's very nearly the size of the floppy
 (2) Sometimes it fits and sometimes it doesn't
 (3) There's "nothing" in the system.

"Nothing" means nothing beyond the basic boot-up necessities
plus a few programs in bin.  The difference between "it fits"
and "it doesn't fit" might even be accounted for by the luck
of the draw when the ramdisk is compressed.  The failed disks
tend to have everything except the syslinux file, which means
it got really close (or else the directory was written out
without the data actually fitting).  I should have said that
this is the same project each time (as far as I know--and that's
really the point).

But what I'm really wondering is whether I'm going about this
properly.  Has anyone built a floppy with more applications
on it?  Does anyone  write their image to a floppy?  Have I
got something big included (using the "minimal" project) that 
I've overlooked?

I should point out that I don't need my system to fit on a
floppy.  That was just an easy way to start.  I'm going to
use some form of flash disk.  So I don't need any advice
on tricks to make it fit.  I'm just looking for ways to
find out how this thing works, trying to catch any miscon-
ceptions early on.

So far, I like what I see.   I really would like to learn
how it works.

I wouldn't worry very much about the floppy. peewee wasn't (I think) really
intended for this, it's a small distribution, not a "micro" :)

once you get a compact flash and start playing with it you will see it works
very nicely.

regarding floppies, I think the minimal target (in unchanged) fits in one.
however, you can't do nothing interesting with it. if you require floppy I
have some bookmarks of distribution that fit, for routers, etc..

I think another package (sh-utils) has a proper su.

	I have now a improved version for the Linux Kiosk with the PeeWee distro
and running completely in RAM, so I'm avoiding the disconnection problem
and disks issues. Thanks Adi and all the list !!

	But I'm having a little problem with Netscape because, it is not accepting
the .netscape directory even with the same permissions (in fact even the
tar gzziped version that was running), and ask me every boot up to accept
the licence agreement. With other kiosks I made, the thing was avoided:

copy the .netscape dir to the home of netscapeUser .

su netscapeUser -c "netscape -no-spl....-geom...0+0"

but the su implementation in busybox don't support this sintaxis (-c string
command).

If anyone have other solution or idea, please let me know, thanks again !!

I though someone might say that theirs fits with room to spare and
that it didn't fit until they figured out they had to do such-and-such.
But it looks like that's not the case.   Clearly all of peewee's users
have moved on to bigger media.   As I shall, shortly.

I chose peewee *because* it wasn't trying to fit a floppy.  I looked
at many "embedded" sites and many were no good for me because of this.
I found the following on a website.  It's in a discussion between Ralph
and Adi:
 
  "Also, nobody is targeting the 3MB - 32MB systems."

So, think "niche".

>however, you can't do nothing interesting with it. 

You can do demonstrations like showing that it works, and also to
quickly become familiar with which commands you didn't realize
you couldn't live without :)

BTW I notice that bin has the "real" versions of the programs.  It
might be that a busybox implementation would leave room for other
files.

>if you require floppy
No, I said I didn't.  Actually I have a Coyote router at home, so I
know what floppy systems are for.

I've got an sbc on order but until then I'm going to target a hard
drive.  The Adventure continues in next message...

Thanks!

Message-ID: <2.2.16.20020725150301.6ec7c282@zmicro.com>

So, I thought, I should target a hard drive on a computer, that
will let me get used to running the IDE interface and give me
some room to start building the real application.  

I made a little space at the end of the second drive on my host
system and figured I'd write it there.  Should work, no?

Well, nobody really uses a hard drive for embedded work.  A flash
IDE drive is supported, but the instructions seem to indicate
that the master boot record gets written, which isn't what I'm
looking for.  So I choose a floppy, and lie to it that the
floppy is at /dev/hdb11.  It writes out fine, the partition 
is a DOS filesystem with the kernel and ramdisk and boot files.
I tell the host system lilo to add that image.   All is OK.

Except that when I go there, syslinux starts and wants to read
everything off the floppy drive.

Last night I went to the syslinux site and it looks like I can
change the drive syslinux is reading from...if I can actually
get the BIOS to recognize an extended partition on the second
drive.  Failing that, I think DOS will see it and I can use
LOADLIN to start it.   Eventually I could probably work it 
out with lilo if I knew what peewee did for each option.   
Still, it's all a temporary step on the way to the real target.

Tinkering is fun.

I am able to boot a peewee system from hdb11 if I boot DOS first
and use LOADLIN.   I can't get syslinux to do it, but I don't
know what the problem is there.  (I'm not sure how it knows
which device to read).  But OK, I'll skip that one for now.

I have discovered that the pwlconfig Help file has a newer
version of documentation than the 0.19 in ./Documentation
It's found in ./scripts/README.pwlconfig.    So I'm going 
to read that to see what tidbits I can find.

I used peewee for a while in a partition, before the CF arrived.

the simplest way would be to .tgz the mnt directory of your project after
extracting files, and copying it to the partition, the booting it the way
you prefer.

worked fine for me. this way I was running from disk, not ramdrive.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020726174315.02bb0960@mail.ecofor.cl>

I have a working PWL that works in a 32MBytes flash disk when is compressed.

When I'm trying another configuration (uncompressed in ext2 or RO ext2 
partition with multiple RAM disks) it doesn't start the Xserver. All the 
distro fits in 25 MBytes, so is not a lack of space and 128MBytes RAM never 
is reached (when compressed with RAM disks I cannot use a complete 64MBytes 
memory).

Any idea ??

I think you mean to say I would untar it in the new partition so that 
it would the be a copy of the project's ./mnt directory.  That would
work.  I guess it would resemble a conventional Linux system.

In reading the help file, I see that I can "extract a file system"...
"to any mount point".  Since my host and target are the same 
hardware, I should be able to have it copy the files directly there and
get the same result.


What I did today was realize that if LOADLIN would boot it, that LILO
should also.  I just had to get the boot parameters right.  After
messing about a bit I was able to achieve that.   So now I've got
a PeeWee partition that I can boot directly, using the compressed
files built by pwlconfig.

Did you change anything, or is it just that it's uncompressed?

Is it that X doesn't start, or does it start and then give up?

X makes a log when it starts, and X will fail for any number
of reasons, including having the wrong mouse.

If you don't get X but get a login prompt, log in and type
runlevel to see if your runlevel changed (it's normally 5 if
you want X)

Barry:
         I only change the target 'style', the hole system is the same and 
the machine is the same (video card, mouse, etc.). As it is only 
uncompressed (or RO partition with multiple RAM) and the files fits without 
problem in the drive, I cannot know anything because if I comment the line 
with the Xserver in the rc file, all works fine, but if the Xserver is 
enabled, it locks the target PC. I cannot acces any log file.
         Is OK for me to use it compressed, but I think that can be faster 
to load an uncompressed file system. Better if I can save the memory for 
the RAM disk using a RO root partition. Maybe I'm wrong in this, but the RO 
filesystem with multiple RAM disks was faster and uses less memory than any 
other configuration. (this two tips are very important to me now). Please 
let me know if any of this asseverations is not right.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] problems, show up in ldconfig
Message-ID: <2.2.16.20020730161635.6d6fc9d0@zmicro.com>

I managed to reproduce an eariler problem I had, which looks
like a problem with ldconfig, but it isn't really.  When I see:

  Editing inittab...failed                                                
  Building ld.so.cache...ldconfig: Can't stat /lib: No such file or direc 
  ldconfig: Can't stat /usr/lib: No such file or directory                
  ldconfig: Can't open configuration file /etc/ld.so.conf: No such file o 
  ldconfig: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: No such  
   
it means I have forgotten to "Extract File System for Project".  It's 
easy to forget, and pwlconfig doesn't check to see if mnt is empty.

Okay, good FAQ entry.   BUT!  (here's part 2)

I've attempted to add some packages to my system.  Building the
target system says that it _succeeded_, yet in the log, I see:

  .
  .
  Editing inittab...ok 
  Building ld.so.cache...ldconfig: Can't open configuration file /etc/ld.
  /lib:
         libtermcap.so.2 -> libtermcap.so.2.0.8 
         libnss_files.so.2 -> libnss_files-2.1.3.so 
         libcrypt.so.1 -> libcrypt-2.1.3.so 
         libc.so.6 -> libc-2.1.3.so 
         ld-linux.so.2 -> ld-2.1.3.so 
  /usr/lib: 
  ok 
  Unmounting loopback device...ok 
  Compressing /dev/loop0 into ramdisk...3416+0 records in
  3416+0 records out  
  .
  .

Is that one of those "nuisance errors" as in "nothing to do" ?
The target system comes up but I don't know enough about it
yet to know if it's all there.

Other times I get actual failures in that area.  Usually when 
I've modified a project and build it for the first time.  It
fails a few times and then when I come back later it succeeds
without my having changed it.  It seems to be connected with
the setting of some variables, but I haven't been able to 
"trick it" just by quitting pwlconfig and re-entering.  But
I do log out a lot and restart the system frequently, so, I'll \
keep observing.

If you do have a console attached, you could boot up in 
runlevel 3 [ change this line in  etc/inittab :

id:5:initdefault

 change the 5 to a 3 and recopy your system ]  then you'll get a 
login prompt.  Once logged in you type startx.   Well, I hope it's
startx, but embedded X may be stripped down to a simpler command.
This might let you find out what's up with X.

With a slow hard drive and a fast processor, it's faster to load 
less from the hard drive and let the CPU uncompress it.  But with 
a flash disk and a not-so-fast processor, it may be the other way
around  You would have to test it.

I don't know enough about this to help.
