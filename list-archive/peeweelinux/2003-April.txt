Cool,

Yep, this works nice. Thanks.

Create a file named something like "30nfsmount", mode 0755, that is simply:

#!/bin/sh
/bin/mount -a -t nfs

Obviously, make sure it's numbered at least one step higher than your 
networking config. (I've completely rewritten the networking 
initialization, so don't remember the defaults...)

Then add this file as a custom file that gets put into /etc/rcS.d/ upon 
build. Increase it's complexity as necessary...

Hello,

I'm trying to create an floppy image file on my HD and then send it
to a friend. But I am not able to it since the only options i see in
the pwlconfig is doing it into a partition or a device. I tried to
attach a loop device with no luck.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Yuval

Do it to an actual floppy, then use 'dd' to pull it off the floppy to a 
file. Something like 'dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/var/tmp/floppy.img bs=2048' 
should do the trick (check that for errors first).

that's a nice idea. I even got a zip drive already on my comp. Yet it
could be nice to have it as an option called, let's say, 'compressed
image with bootloadre to a file'.

I could be wrong about this, but I think there's a practical difficulty 
associated with doing that. It's my understanding that the boot image has 
hard coded in it the specific spot on the partition table where the root 
image lives, and so you'd have to redo that for each new device. Otherwise 
we wouldn't need lilo at all. By forcing you to install to an actual 
device, pee wee assures itself that all of the relevant information is 
available to it during the install. There may be a way to set up a 
loopback device with a number of virtual cylinders, heads, etc., 
concurrent with your freind's harware, I haven't explored this option.

That is vary interesting and gives me some vary important points to
think about.

That means I will have to install lilo on my friend's machine
manually and then add the root filesystem. Doesn't it?

My other option looks like using syslinux somehow. (i think !??)

Thanks,

Hello,

I've updated autobootx so that it fixes a minor inconvenience when booting =
into runmode 3. (I've changed /etc/inittab in case you just want to copy =
that file....) I've attached it to this email.=20

As for questions about getting more than 16 colors, try the following:

The X server used is the VGA16 server, which is 16 color. GTK apps *DO* =
look poor with the default colors and this server. The only thing to do is =
to select the server that your video hardware uses in pwlconfig. It =
doesn't hurt to have more than one server installed (its just more disk =
space). Then you need XFree86 to point to that driver. So go to pwlconfig =
and select your x server, whether it is SVGA or whatever....

To actually "specify" to XFree86 that you want to use another server =
(driver), go to your "custom" folder in the project and change the symlink =
to point to your server for your video card. Take a look at custom/usr/X11/=
bin/X  (I think this is the path??)  which is the symlink to your server. =
if you do a "ls -l" you should see that this symlink points to the VGA16 =
server. Point it to your server of interest using the "ln" command. You =
can now try building it and reboot.=20

At this point you should be able to run XFree with your particular server =
with the default config file (I havnet tried this, but it probably works =
since it is so generic...). Then you can tweak your XF86Config file on the =
running system to try out different colors, resolutions, and such, that =
are supported by that card. The actual config will vary depending on your =
card.=20

BTW, if you type "linux 3" at the lilo prompt you will boot into normal =
runmode without autologin and autobooting of X. This helps debugging X. =
You may have to switch to terminal 2 (by typing alt-F2) after the boot =
process. There is a bug in my inittab file, which I have fixed on my =
machine and attached tot his email.=20

Thanks, I am glad you got some use out of this, and that it worked out of =
the box. I think you are the first person to confirm that it worked. =20

BTW, I am trying to get some default install that works on multiple =
machines with more than 16 colors. It may not be possible with one setup, =
but I was looking into framebuffer as one possible solution. Unfortunately =
a lot of cards don't seem to fully support VESA 2.0 these days. If anyone =
has any ideas, please let me know. I'd hate to have scripts at bootup to =
change aorund video hardware configs! Also, my card is only supported by =
XFree86 4.x, so I am stuck with 16 colors for now... :o(=20

Hello Ken Emmons,

I am using your Autoboot project with X windows support . It has worked.

but the screen is 640x480,and color-depth is less than 16.

my gtk app doesn't work with this configure.my gtk app need 800x600,16 =
colors at least.

I had try to modfiy the /etc/X11/XF86conf. but it is failing.

Please ,give me some suggestions how  to do it.


  thanks for you bootx.gz ,it is good example.

   thank you very much.

Hi,

	I use an ant automated telnet session to deploy software to my peewee

	I run my program with ./program& on a telnet session, but it exits when the
telnet session ends. Isn't linux supposed do daemonize background threads ?
	If not, how can I do it ? should I use nohup ?

thanks

Hi Ricardo,

Linux doesn't daemonize in this case -- your program is still attached to its 
parent (your telnet session), and it will exit when the parent exits.

If your are programming in C, the following is a good example of how to 
"daemonize" a process, using the fork() system call.

Message-ID: <se9bbbdb.029@qatech.com>

Hello,

I have done just this. 

With Peewee you just put your RTAI kernel in /boot and your modules in /lib in the custom folder of your proect. They get copied over the stock peewee kernel during the build. 

The only other hitch is that I had to use insmod from my debian system since the one that came with peewee doesn't seem to find the modules automatically. If you can live with typing in full paths to the modules it isnt a big deal though. There may be other ways around this, I am not sure.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] newbies question .list files empty and tar's contain all 0
Message-ID: <1501207045.20030415161845@mpch-mainz.mpg.de>

Hi all,

I just installed PeeWee on RedHat 9 and followed the quick reference to
setup a sample project. This failed as the created files system was empty.
So I checked the .list files, which were generated at the beginning and
they are all empty. The tar files have the same length and they contain
0's.
I guessed that perhaps my rpm is not working correctly (empty list files
come from corrupted tar file coming from broken rpm ?) but a rpm -q -l
-p on a given file listed correctly content of the rpm archive.
What am I'm doing wrong ?
Is it a problem that the underlying development system is RH 9 and the
rpm's in the PeeWee distribution are not corresponding to the installed
ones ?
I got the same results with Suse 8.1 and hoped that RH 9 will work but
apparently I make always the same stupid mistake.


Thanks a lot for any advice !!

Cheers,

Hartwig

Besides the way Ken suggests, I wrote a mini HowTo last year on getting 
a 2.4 kernel into PWL in a more detailed manner (2.4 wants newer 
modutils, e2fsprogs, and whatnot):

Perhaps that'll help you out.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] gunzipping ramdisk
Message-ID: <1050562628.12685.705.camel@ralph.plexio.private>

I would like to mount the ramdisk residing on flash (running PWL on a
DOC2000) so changes can be made and then saved again. After mounting the
DOC under PWL, I tried to unzip the ramdisk so I could mount it for
editing. What was a 1.3Meg file ballooned to more than 30Meg after
unzipping the file. I wasn't sure of the exact size because it ran out
of ramdisk space. Surely, 1.3Meg can possibly expand THAT much?!?. I had
renamed "ramdisk" to "ramdisk.gz" and then tried running "gunzip
ramdisk.gz" What is the correct command to unzip the ramdisk? 

Thanks,
Stephen

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Adding nfsroot parameters to lilo
Message-ID: <1050567133.12685.733.camel@ralph.plexio.private>

I added the following bits to the lilo.conf portion in
pwl_target_functions:

image = $rd_bp_kernel
root = /dev/nfs
label = nfs
vga = 768
append = "console=tty2 ip=bootp  \
          nfsroot=192.168.1.200:/export/linux/root"

During the lilo loader phase when writing PWL to a DOC2000, I get the
following error:

Creating lilo.conf in a temporary location...ok
Installing lilo bootloader...Patched LILO for M-Systems' DiskOnChip 2000
LILO version 21, Copyright 1992-1998 Werner Almesberger

Unmounting target device /dev/nftla1...ok

According to nfsroot.txt in the kernel docs (2.4.20), you're suppose to
create a dummy device (mknod /dev/boot255 c 0 255) to satisfy the
root=/dev/nfs requirement. I created the device on the system hosting
prior to runnig pwlconfig but that didn't help lilo recognize /dev/nfs.
How do  I do this with pwlconfig or manually. 

Thanks,

Subject: [Peeweelinux] CF card problem
Message-ID: <3E9EAADF.700@volja.net>

I just want to know why it is not wise to use IDE adapters with CF
cards. Why is fdisk causing troubles with CF cards?
I have used IDE adapter on my computer and it worked fine for some time.
But now i have problem. I cant format the CF card anymore. Sometimes i
can get it working but only if i format it in windows and then format it
again with fdisk. My project works fine for now but it is configured for
  read-only operations. But i need at least 1 partition for storing some
information in case that power fails. So if IDE adapters are only
suitable for read-only how can i overcome that problem.

Please i need some answers soon.
Thanks in advance

Hello,

Did you try other flash cards witht he same setup? Just asking because I had problems witha  Kingston card in one system, but not the other. I tried Sandisk and it worked on both systems. Both computers used an IDE adapter. I am not sure if this helps, but give it a try if you haven't already.

can get it working but only if i format it in windows and then format it
again with fdisk. My project works fine for now but it is configured for
  read-only operations. But i need at least 1 partition for storing some
information in case that power fails. So if IDE adapters are only
suitable for read-only how can i overcome that problem.

Please i need some answers soon.
Thanks in advance

Subject: [Peeweelinux] CF Problem
Message-ID: <NIENLBNOFJMGGDDNKJGKMEHNCFAA.stefanw@intellanet.com>

Hey guys,
This isn't specifically a PWL problem, but i'm hoping with everyone's
experience in cf cards, someone may have run across this issue.

I have an advantech board, which uses a CF card for the system. I load the
filesystem and partitions onto the cf card from a desktop computer using a
cf Card reader. I then insert the cf card into the advantech board, and
occasionally, notice that one file may inadvertantly become a block device
file. (Marked with a 'b'). This doesn't always happen, and only seems to
happen when first creating the card. Once things are booted on the advantech
board correctly, it always works correctly.

file on CF via Advantech board
brwxrwxrwx            1, 2  Apr 1  2003 mymodule.so
file on CF via CF Card Reader
-rwxrwxrwx		  300567  Apr 1  2003 mymodule.so


I have noticed an inconvenient way of fixing the problem.
Scenario:
	Load CF card from desktop machine.
	Boot card from Advantech board.
	Notice a particular file has become a block device file.
	Shutdown system.
	Mount partition on CF card from my desktop machine using a CF card reader.
	copy (not move) the offending file (*Note: the file appears correctly when
mounted through the CF Card Reader on my desktop)
	remove original file
	rename copy to original file name.
	boot card from advantech board.
	All is well!

I suspect something about a file residing on a particular sector that
doesn't get read correctly when mounted through the advantech board? I'm
trying to learn about how files are stored on disk, etc, to see if there is
a way to repair it.

I have been hunting for information regarding this problem with no luck.
Advantech suggested trying a different brand of cf cards as the chipsets may
be different than what they have tested. I have tried a few so far, with no
luck. I'll keep trying brands they have suggested.

Anyone else ever have an issue like this?
Any suggestions on repairing the block device file automatically?
Can Anyone with disk file experience explain what changes may occur to cause
a file to become a block device file?

This bug is really starting to get to me. Any suggestions anyone may have
would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

Right, but the device you name in "root=" needs to be the same
as the dummy device you created. So either say "root=/dev/boot255"
or rename the device to "/dev/nfs".

I gotcha, thanks Dennis.  In the mean time, I added root=/dev/nfs to the
append line and that seemed fix the problem.

Hello

I am working with sandisk CF card and i have that problem. I want to 
know if anyone is using IDE adapter for CF card on target system in 
read-write mode. Because if i use CF as read-only then everything works. 
But if i use it as read-write i had problems because sometimes fsck 
finds problems and deletes some files from CF and my system becomes 
unusable.

Is this problem hapening because i used linux fdisk to create 
partitions? I saw that some have had that problem. if this is the 
problem does anyone know why is it happening?

Currently I am using CF with compressed ramdrive. This works well but is RO. 

I am, however, mounting flash disk as read/write to save data, and then mounting back to RO. This works well for me.

Sure: for starters you need to go into the font directory under /etc/X11 
and edit the config file and remove the listing for 75dpi fonts (you can 
also check that the other fonts listed correspond with real files). Then 
you need to start up xfs (that's the font server). Then you need to link X 
in your /usr/X11R6/bin directory to one of the font servers. Finally, you 
need to configure XF86Config under /usr/X11R6/lib for your graphics 
display and mouse.

gunzip file should do it.  These programs are generally smart 
enough to tell you if your file isn't a zip file.   It _is_ possible
to compress a file 100:1  especially if it is
an empty file.

The file system that appears there should be the compressed version
of the one pwl built.  cd to to the projects directory, to the
name of your project, and then to mnt.    Then, issue the
du -h    command to see how much got put in there.   It may
be possible to create a lot of empty space through the pwl 
configurations but I'm not sure of that and I'm not much good 
looking at their scripts.

Thanks Barry. I was hoping to be able to make permanent changes to the
ramdisk file while running pwl/doc. Is there any other way other than to
uncompress the whole ramdisk file to the ramdisk? Ultimately I would
like to make modifications to lilo.conf or any other file in pwl without
having to pull out the DOC and doing it in a reader.

Thanks,
Stephen

I don't have a DOC so my drive looks like an ordinary IDE 
drive.  I'd hope the DOC, once the right drivers are attached,
would behave similarly.  But I can't help with those 
specifics.

As I said, pwl gives various disk-making options, but I 
don't understand it well enough to know what I'm getting
without trying it and looking at the results, or to alter 
the scripts to give me a different combination.

But I am faced with the same challenge as you.  I will 
want to store altered information.  I can offer two ideas.

(1) Add a separate partition that is mounted read/write and
use that for the modified info.  You have probably seen 
discussions about this before.

(2) As for your approach, when my system boots, it does 
exactly what you are trying to do.  It says, "copying 
filesystem /dev/hda2 to /dev/ram2" and it is 
uncompressed into memory.  The running system runs from
/dev/ram2.  I can log in and I can modify
files just like you say.  The missing link then, is to
be able to compress the results into a new ramdisk image
and write it back to your disk-on-chip.  Although at this
point is doesn't seem all that different from the idea
in #(1), and perhaps more work (and risk).

I use the option "Compressed ramdisk on ext2 partition" as
the target environment to make my system.  Note that you 
can ask for an uncompressed one as well, and at least
see what size you get.

Barry

mode. I need this answer for my project and i would like some information if CF
card is suitable for this because i had problems with it.
I know i have put this question before but i didnt't get any answer from

what I learned from the manufacturers:

A compact flash card is good for about 500,000 writes per sector. Industrial
strength cards suggest about 2,000,000 writes per sector.

So, it depends on your usage.
I use it to store a ram disk image, and configuration files to limit the
number of writes to the card.

Message-ID: <3EA5E470.4010506@iinet.net.au>

Hi

I am currently at work experience and trying to set up peewee linux. I 
have a PCM-3350 GX1 300Mhz Embedded PC and have a Sandisk 256M Compact 
Flash card that I want to install the operating system on.

I have heard bad reports about formatting and partitioning CF cards and 
this is where I am up to at the moment. I guess I need to partition the 
CF card with a boot sector (hda1)  OS (hda2) and swap (hda3).

I have already experimented with the embedded PC using an ide HDD that I 
have installed Redhat 8 on. The CF card just arrived and I placed it in 
the CompactFlash socket and it is recognised in the bios as an ide 
device however I have no idea on how to mount it.

While reading about PCMCIA I noticed in relation to CF cards about 
"ftl_format -i /dev/mem0c0c" however this file (mem0c0c) isn't even in 
my dev directory. Also after reading the man page for ftl_format I 
noticed that you are able to create a boot secotor which perhaps is what 
I need.

Any help on setting up the Compact Flash Card so I can start installing 
peewee linux would be much appreciated.

Okay, a bunch of people have written about this, so I want to set some 
things straight.

Here's what I think is going on:

1). PWL is probably having even more problems running under RH 8.x than it 
did under 7.x. My advice: go back and install 6.2 (that's right) on your 
development platform. You should be able to get it online, it will make 
your life much easier. 
2). This stuff about things not working on Compact flash is half nonsense. 
IDE Compact flash cards are pin-compatible with ide hard disks (if you 
look online they even sell header boards which route all the signals 
without modifying them), so Pee Wee runs fine on both ATA compact flash 
and ATA PCMCIA cards. There are some cards that are sold as "memory" cards 
that do not have the IDE circuitry built in that will not work (as BOOT 
devices, but fine for storing info once card services is loaded), but if 
you get a card that says it shows up as an ide device then it will work 
provided the card is working (flash drives can wear out). If you have 
questions about a given card that you have, plug it in to a machine that 
has the pcmcia drivers and utlities installed properly and see what 
cardinfo/cardctl have to say about the device.

Pee Wee will automatically (thanks Adi!) do all of the partitioning, so 
all you need to figure out is where on the development platform the target 
device is installed and tell pwlconfig in one of the setup screens. For 
compact flash and PCMCIA devices, either during startup or when the device 
is inserted it should tell you, for instance "/dev/hde1". You can use the 
dmesg command to show information about the boot, otherwise it should 
print the info to your console during a card insertion. Make sure you're 
not using your host drive as the target, or you will not be happy with the 
results. The command df will tell you where your host drives are mounted 
so you can check. 
3). If you are installing pee wee on a Disk on Chip, then you need to do 
more work, because the kernel you use must have the right drivers, and I 
will refer the reader to past posts in the archives for the appropriate 
info.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Mouse PS2 problem
Message-ID: <183653312.20030423084617@icid.edu.cu>

Hello ,
 After several changes I'm runing X, but my PS2 mouse is not
 recognized (I have to use AllowMouseOpenFail in
 ServerFlags/XF86Config) .
 I only get a X on the screen and a report of :
 
 --------
 'Cannot open mouse (No such device) - Continuing...'
 ----------
 
 Then I add gpm to my linux image , and when I run gpm I get the
 following message :
 
 ---------
 gpm : oops() invoked from gpm.c(984)
 /dev/mouse : no such device
 ----------

 dev/mouse exists and it is a symlink to /dev/psaux.
 
 I wonder if you would be so kind to help me with this problem.

I am happy to be wrong about that. Did you have to do anything special 
(beyond the kgcc changes) to get it running? Are you using a stock kernel 
or one you've compiled yourself?

That error message suggests the kernel doesn't contain a
ps/2 mouse driver, either built in or as a module. Can you
check your kernel build configuration file and verify
you have the right mouse features enables?

In my custom kernel I have enabled :
Character Devices -> [*] Mouse Support (not serial mouse)
Character Devices -> Mice -> <*> Microsoft busmouse support
Character Devices -> Mice -> [*] PS/2 mouse (aka "auxiliary device") support

Is this enough ? Or I have to add another module or change a
configuration file ?

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Redhat 6.2 ISO Burning corruption
Message-ID: <3EA7570E.107@iinet.net.au>

Hi

I have taken the advise about using redhat 6.2 to avoid troubles however 
it has created these problems in the process.

I have downloaded these 3 files from /redhat/linux/6.2/en/iso/i386

redhat-6.2-doc.iso
redhat-6.2-i386.iso
redhat-6.2-srpms.iso

I then used NERO and selected burn image however it said wrong block 
size and gave me the option to correct it or ignore it. It was preset on 
2048 and I tried burning it.

All the files appear on the cdrom however some of the files are 
corrupted for example you can't even copy them.

I then changed the block size and re-tried burning it however this time 
it didn't even register. I then burnt it using Easy CD creator which 
didn't give me an error at all but some of the files were still corrupt.

Obviously because these files are corrupt I was unable to boot from them 
even when I downloaded boot.img and tried booting it from the floppy. I 
got /module/module-info corrupt and it exited the install.

Are the files (*.iso) I have downloaded (1.8G worth) corrupt and should 
I try another site or is it another problem which I am overlooking.

I would think that's OK. I don't have bus mouse support
turned on, but otherwise my config's the same. Your
selection of bus mouse shouldn't do anything since you
don't seem to have selected any of the specific bus
mouse options.

How about /dev/psaux? You said it exists, but maybe
it's got the wrong major or minor number. 'ls -l /dev/psaux'
should show:

crw-------    1 root     root      10,   1 Apr 24 20:16 /dev/psaux

My "ls -l" result is somehow diferent from yours :

----------------------
ls -l /dev/psaux
crw-rw----     1 root     root    10,    1 May 5 1998 /dev/psaux

----------------------
ls -l /dev/mouse
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root      root    5 Apr 24 13:09 /dev/mouse -> psaux
---------------------

My psaux is very old ,and I don't know why.
I'm running Peewee Linux Configurator Version 0.61.1 over a RH7.3
host.I will appreciate any help.

It looks like your permissions are the problem. Check out the chmod 
command using man: set them so that they match the output below.

 Hi

When I log on as root I get ulimit: not found.

When I log in as admin and try and create a file it says Permission =

How can I make it so that I can write to the compact flash and it will =

My configuration for the target system is as follows:

All have the same error message when trying to boot up.

I have read through the newsgroup and one other person had a similar

Hi Troy and Adi and Ricardo and Leif and PWL archive

**********************************************************************
Target System = PCM-3350 GX1 300MHz
Developement PC = Redhat 6.2 with all the rpm's installed as specified 
in Reference
**********************************************************************

Troy has helped me so far with this problem but I noticed in the 
peewelinux archives that you all seem to know a bit in this area so any 
help you can give me would be much appreciated.

Thankyou for your answer Troy (attached at bottom) I have another CF 
that is branded Sandisk Ultra 256M compact flash. That I tried instead 
of the Kodac 128M CF

I have recompiled the kernel and made sure that all of the filesystems 
including ext2 fat16 and all the other ones are compiled in and not only 
as modules.

The things that I notice as fishy are

when PWL configures it it creates 3 partitions

Partition        Contents
hdc1               boot.b    bzImage    initrd    map
hdc2                bin    boot     dev    etc    lib    mnt    proc    
rc.init    root    sbin    tmp    usr    var
hdc3                **Is there but I can't mount it and no documentation 
about formating it during target install**

I then have a look at /etc/lilo.conf and find the following which seems 
really wacky so I have included the lines that I changed in bold
*********************************
disk=/dev/sda    *disk=/dev/hdc*
    bios=0x80
    heads=4

    cylinders=490

    read-only
    root=/dev/hda1                *root=/dev/hdc2*
    vga=0x317
***************************************
However i don't even think it is accessing this file yet.

After these changes (new kernel, updated lilo.conf file) I get the same 
errors as before (ioctl) plus more errors I am thinking because of all 
the extra file systems I built into the kernel that try and recognise it 
but fail.
I have tried using the kernels supplied with pwl such as bzImage-full 
and selecting modules but no go there either.

Incase some more of the errors being produced would be helpful here they 
are:

*********************************************
Partition check:
hdc: hdc1 hdc2 hdc3
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem).

tcsetpgrp: Inappropriate ioctl for device
Invalid session number or type of track
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 01:02
*********************************************

I am able to get it to work when I use a Compressed ramdisk on ext2 
partition however that is not practical because it installs it all on 
hdc1 with no other partitions. I need it Uncompressed on ext2 partition 
so that I can write data to the hdc2 partition.

Do you know what hdc3 is used for is it meant to be a swap or something? 
I tried partitioning it,(mke2fs) so that I could mount it and everything 
however to no avail at bootup.

I have been reading the Bootdisk HOWTO and they have this error under 
their troubleshooting and say there is only a few problems here and to 
check the rdev -R on /dev/hdc1/bzImage. I followed through this 
possibility but it did nothing.

Apparently you can look up what device 01:02 is in the format XX:YY in 
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt however I didn't understand this.

Thankyou for any help you can give me,  I will document any successful 
help I am given in my writeup.

the uncompressed ext2 image (second partition) is copied to a ramdisk as
umounted afterwards. from your post it looks like you are not aware of this.

as for a data partition the third partition is the way to go, just format it
and add a line to mount it to fstab.

However shouldn't that be /dev/hdc2 for my case.

And what must I do to get the boot process past this fatal error.

Yes I have formatted partition 3 however I am still unable to get to the login screen.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Kernel Panic

References: <PPEJJDOIBFJHGGGEELNNKEKMFJAA.Ricardo.Trindade@myrealbox.com> <3EAE55A6.2080602@iinet.net.au>

Ok, let's start at the beginning and try to get you straight, with some 
infos along the way.

1) what is "hdc" on your build machine can be anything on your embedded 
board. I happen to use this exact board, the PCM-3350.  For me, on my 
build machine the target is "sdb", but when booting on the PCM-3350, the 
CF is "hdc". As far as I can tell, it will always be hdc on the PCM-3350.

In the PWL gui config, go into "Configure Target Hardware". Your options 
may be slightly different, but as a general guidline use these:

- Target: Uncompressed ramdisk, boot from ext2 partition -->
- Target Device: "/dev/sdb"
- Boot Device on Target System: "/dev/hdc"

2) Now the PWL gui should be able to build everything onto the flash 
chip as normal. You've noticed that there's an extra "hdc3" laying 
around -- in order to do it, you need to add a little trickery:

- Make sure you have a kernel with desired options for the filesystem 
(meaning, I upgraded to kernel 2.4.18 to be able to use ext3 on hdc3, 
instead of ext2)

- After PWL gui builds the chip, format hdc3 and populate it; I mount 
hdc3 as /opt, so I have a script called "makeopt.sh" that does all this. 
In general, you need to do at least:

   echo "Creating filesystem..."
   mke2fs -j -b 1024 -m0 /dev/sdb3
   mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb3 /mnt/usbdev

   [... INSERT CUSTOM POPULATION STUFF HERE ...]

   echo "Syncing and unmounting..."
   sync
   umount /mnt/usbdev

3) Now your hdc3 is ready to be used, but PWL knows nothing about it. 
But, there's a little hack you can do. PWL, on boot, will run a script 
called "/etc/rc.modules" if it exists. Create a 
<PWLDIR>/custom/rc.custom script (mode 0755) that has the following in it:

   # this all happens before filesystems are mounted

   # this is so we can mount our ext3 /opt
   mkdir /opt
   echo "/dev/hdc3 /opt ext3 defaults 1 2" >> /etc/fstab

Go back into the PWL gui, and use the features to make custom/rc.modules 
copied to "/etc/rc.modules". Extract the filesystems again (important!), 
then rebuild the flash chip. Rerun your "makeopt.sh" script to redo hdc3 
partition.

Now stick that chip in the PCM-3350 and it should boot fine -- the 
default BIOS assigns the CF/IDE adapter as hdc (there are already two 
onboard IDE channels hda and hdb for adding real hardrives).

Do NOT go screwing around with lilo.conf or anything else, if you 
configure PWL correctly and use these guidelines, it all should "just 
work" with little effort. This PCM-3350 has been super easy to work with 
for me, nary a problem.

hope this helps...

Hey there

 > > - Boot Device on Target System: "/dev/hdc"
Was my biggest downfall in the help is says
************************************************
Boot Device: /dev/hda
How the target device will be known as on the final target system
It is unlikely you will need to change this parameter.
*************************************************
After changing this to /dev/hdc it obviously found where to boot from 
and stopped giving me the kernel panic and I can now
login which is great.

I don't have a Compact Flash to ide adapter so I have installed Redhat 
6.2 on a hard disk connected to the PCM-3350.
which means that my target system is hdc I am assuming ithat sda would 
be the default when using this adapter.

to change any of the files what I do since everything is running in 
ramdisk I mount the partitions.
mount -t ext2 /dev/hdc2 /mnt/cf2
mount -t ext2 /dev/hdc3 /mnt/cf3
And do all my changes this way that way when I boot up next time 
everything will have taken place.

Is there a command to flush everything in ramdisk to the CF card? 
Because all the changes are only
made to ramdisk at the time so when I reboot the ramdisk is of course 
rebooted and none of my
changes have taken place.

I like what you were doing with /opt and hdc3 I will give that a go.

I realy appreciate the effort you went to to write this all out for me.
Enjoy your day.

Sorry, not what I meant -- the PCM-3350 has a CF slot built right in, on 
the underside of the board (flipside of where the power connector is). 
This slot is recognized by the BIOS as "hdc" (secondary master). The 
sda/sdb usage in my case is because my dev machine recognizes the CF 
reader (on the USB port) as a SCSI device.

Looks like in your case you'll have hda (RH 6.2 harddrive) and hdc (CF 
slot). Even easier. ;)

For hdc2, you should really work on using PWL's built in "custom" files 
ability; look at the PWL archives, and you'll see many examples how we 
use the custom/ folder features to make core changes to the subsystem.

No -- a ramdisk is a compressed image which is loaded from disk into 
ram; once loaded it's no longer tied to the disk in any way, shape, or 
form. You best bet is to:

a) use the custom/ features of PWL to make core changes
b) keep editable things on hdc3 (/opt).

For instance, for my project I'll never know how the device will connect 
to the internet until it makes it to a client site. As such, I rewrote 
the networking subsytem to completely live in /opt/, and support PPP, 
DHCP, static, CDMA and CDPD (GPRS coming) which can be flipped by the 
end client at runtime, and "stick".

Another handy use is to edit the core PWL to include a simple 
/etc/rcS.d/07local script like this:

   #!/bin/sh
   # run any per-unit customs
   if [ -f /opt/etc/rc.custom ]; then
     /opt/etc/rc.custom
   fi
   exit 0

Then, because this is run right at boot, you can have a sticky 
/opt/etc/rc.custom script which does neat things (links in a new 
/etc/localtime, sets the time/date, enables debug syslogs, whatever you 
can dream up!). Handy for online remote field debugging, that's for sure.
