<PRE>&gt;<i>Additionally, in case the obvious has been overlooked, you need a file 
</I>&gt;<i>/etc/resolv.conf with the desired nameservers, eg:
</I>
&gt;<i>search foo.com
</I>&gt;<i>search bar.com
</I>&gt;<i>nameserver 192.168.0.1
</I>&gt;<i>nameserver 192.168.0.37
</I>
What is the purpose of the &quot;search&quot; lines, especially if
it needs to resolve foo.com or bar.com to even be able
to use them?  Or are they assumed to be in hosts?

&gt;<i>When apps using libnss_dns fire up, the libs use this file as it's 
</I>&gt;<i>config of which nameservers to talk to...
</I>
I read that libresolv does the name lookups.  I don't have
libnss_dns installed.   I installed nslookup.  When I
run it, it does not complain about any libraries missing.
The result of nslookup is:

Server:     default
Address:    default

*** Unknown host

Finally I want so clarify my intent which is to be able to
use a domain name, for instance, if I want to fetch a package
off a site somewhere.  So it's not a manual operation, 
rather some other program would be thinking it could use
a URL.  Although, if it's possible to run the output of 
nslookup through a shell script to get this done instead of 
having to install some other program, that would be 
interesting.

It's not all that obvious. I'm trying to piece it together
so I understand which parts do which.  For example I could
not ping anything until I added a default route.  I can
download stuff if I use the IP address instead of a name.

Information like &quot;libnss-dns is what looks in /etc/resolv.conf&quot;
is very valuable.  We often think a particular program is
responsible.
