This is for when you want to use short notation for a machine -- ie, 
with &quot;search fluid.com&quot; I can then say &quot;ping www&quot; and it knows to search 
the fluid.com domain for the rest, resulting in www.fluid.com.

Well, I can't sepak for nslookup but it sounds about right -- when in 
doubt, use &quot;ldd &lt;foo&gt;&quot; to query a binary to see all it's dynamically 
linked libs (and handy if you have multiple versions of a lib, it'll 
tell you exactly which one the program is using).

On my PeeWee instance, nslookup is just a symlink over to busybox. On a 
real RH62 system (which PeeWee is based on):

# ldd `which nslookup`
   libdns.so.5 =&gt; /usr/lib/libdns.so.5 (0x4001c000)
   libcrypto.so.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0 (0x40105000)
   libisc.so.4 =&gt; /usr/lib/libisc.so.4 (0x401be000)
   libnsl.so.1 =&gt; /lib/libnsl.so.1 (0x401f0000)
   libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x40207000)
   libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4021a000)
   /lib/ld-linux.so.2 =&gt; /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)

So, obviously your mileage may vary. ;) I don't use nslookup in the PWL 
systems, the apps themselves know how to use the C api and call 
gethostbyname(), etc normally. Even the java stuff.

&gt;<i> Finally I want so clarify my intent which is to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> use a domain name, for instance, if I want to fetch a package
</I>&gt;<i> off a site somewhere.  So it's not a manual operation, 
</I>&gt;<i> rather some other program would be thinking it could use
</I>&gt;<i> a URL.  Although, if it's possible to run the output of 
</I>&gt;<i> nslookup through a shell script to get this done instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> having to install some other program, that would be 
</I>&gt;<i> interesting.
</I>
On my PWL boxes, it works just fine -- they are stationed throught the 
USA, and talk to a home server based on it's name, not IP. Never had a 
problem. They all have the same nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf - some 
use PPP, some DHCP, etc.

Methinks something's not quite right on your PWL instance...?
