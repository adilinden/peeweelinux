Subject: [Peeweelinux] CF Read Write Partition
Message-ID: <028e01c35a9c$11fa7310$02fea8c0@jcairns>

Berry,

I have create a CF with 2 partitions I have the first partition setup
with the compressed images and the second partition is where my
application will go. I have verified that everything copied ok by
mounting it on my host computer and doing a ls.

The system boots just fine but the second partition does not mount. You
stated that you changed the fstab file, I have tried that but it still
does not mount.

Both partitions are ext2 type filesystems.

Could you send me a sample of what the fstab needs to look like?

Thanks,

Joe

You said it does not mount but have you tried to mount by hand? What 
happens?
I did this lask week, unfortunatly I don't have the fstab with me right 
now but all I had to do was to create an entry point (/config in my 
case) and add something like this /dev/hda2 /config ext2 defaults 1 2 in 
the fstab.

Adilson,

When I try to mount it states that /dev/hda2 is not a valid block
device.

Did you create the partition manualy with fdisk or cfdisk I believe. 
After that, did you formated it using mke2fs?

Adilson,

First thing thanks for you help.

I am using a 128 mb CF card.

In a quick, looks ok but when it's done, did you tried to do an fdisk -l

Yes and everything looks good.

Here is the output when I ran it on the host.

That's funny as should work. Are you sure the second partition is formated?
If you try to mount /dev/hdc2 by hadn you got the same error?

Adilson,

I do
 
   #mount -n /MTAtm

And I get the same message. Should I be doing the mount command
different?

Adilson,

      vga = normal

Here is my fstab

/dev/ram        /            ext2    defaults        1 1
/dev/hda2       /MTAtm       ext2    defaults        1 2
none            /proc        proc    defaults        0 0

Do you know of anything else I need to look at?

Thanks for all your help.

Well, if it's formated, should work. Try this: login as root, create a 
dummy directory under root lets say mkdir /root/x and do a mount 
/dev/hda2 /mnt/x just to see what happens.

Hello.

I'm having some problems using the new 7.0 ICA client with a peewee 
linux build.
The 6.3 versions look to work ok but the 7.0 sometimes fails with a seg 
fault after the login into the windows server. If I start the client 
again I can get the connection back but I got some flaws on icons 
specialy the little banner on the "start" buttom what makes me wonder if 
can't be some sort of incompatibility with XFree 3.3.6.
Does anyone have this problem?

Hi again.

Somewhat related to my problem with the ICA client, I do like to 
experiment with a newer XFree. Dows anyone here tried to update the 
XFree 3.3.6 to anything newer? How did you do?
My problem is trying to figure out waht libs I have to take with the 
core server.

Hi once more :)

I'm thinking about trying to use a newer browser with peewee. Looks like 
the major contender now is Firebird but albeit small compared to the 
full ones, this baby still has almost 20Mb. Does anyone have an idea how 
to shrink it? I need to run java and, if possible, flash. Opera is 
another contender but a free one would be much better.

Message-ID: <20030808230725.23956.qmail@web10205.mail.yahoo.com>

G'day folks,

Myself and a few mates are in the process of
developing a small embedded system using a PCM-3350
GX1 PC/104 board with the OS to boot off compact
flash. 

I'm currently using RH 9 on a xp2200 with plently of
HDD space. The PeeWeeLinux 0.61.1 package was d/loaded
and successfully installed, but... on attempting to
extract the supplied kernel source the following error
is displayed:

./scripts/pwl_kernel: line 931: 23823 Segmentation
fault      $RPM -i --root $rootDir $rpmOptions
$srcFile
ln: creating symbolic link
`/usr/local/Embedded_Build/kernelbuild/usr/src/linux' 
                           to
`/usr/local/Embedded_Build/kernelbuild/usr/src/linux-2.2.17-13':
No such file or directory

I've complied my own 2.4.20 kernel and had the PC/104
booting successfully, however I would much prefer to
use PWL in terms of managing files <translation: looks
so much easier>. 

I guess i'm 'still' a novice, maybe missing some
fundamental step in the process....

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards,

- Rob Ravlic

I don't know, but RedHat keeps "improving" things, and
rpm went from version 3 to version 4 in the interim.

The good news is that several folks have built a 2.4 kernel
for PeeWee, so you can have your kernel, and pwl, too.  The
mini howto can be found here: 

http://mail.adis.on.ca/pipermail/peeweelinux/2002-June/000608.html

Now, since you already have a kernel, you could skip almost
all that, and just figure out where to put it so PeeWee will
make a system with it.   If you've built one of PeeWee's 2.2
you already have it.  I you haven't this might be the best
way to see how it is done.

I have notes on this...here it is...look in 

Embedded_Build/packages/Kernel_Custom/

With that set up properly, you can pick your kernel right off
the menus!

Thanks Barry,

"MP3 player?  :-)"  
heee, not quite...

RH 9 wasn't doin' it for me so I switched back to RH
7.3 with moderate success. PWL works fine with the
packaged kernel. However... i till not satisfied with
the final result (ie kernel problems etc).

We'll keep working on it but...

Kind of a general question. Has anybody ever thought (or attempted) to
put together a Pee Wee conference or workshop? I'm curious, because I've
been playing for a while and have hit a roadblock. I could really benefit from
spending a few hours with someone who knows what they are doing. Plus,
it might be a good opportunity to exchange ideas. I'm not talking one of these
things that cost a thousand bucks, perhaps something more informal with
volunteers. Anyway, I'd be interested in one near Boston if anyone is keeping
track of this sort  of stuff. - dan

Hi PeeWee'ers:

I've been asked to setup a development environment for PeeWee.  The boss is
thinking it would be great for an upcoming project.  I read on the site that
PeeWee was developed under 6.2.

Does my development machine have to be 6.2?  Any conflicts in going with a
newer version of Linux (8.0 in particular).  The USB support under 6.2 is a
real PITA.

Thanks,
Mike

>Does my development machine have to be 6.2?  

The short answer is "yes".  A slightly longer answer is, "no, if
you do not need to modify anything".

>Any conflicts in going with a newer version of Linux (8.0

Well, here's the long story.  Assuming you don't run afoul
of rpm (I've seen messages to this effect), you can set up
and use a PeeWee system on a newer distro.  My own dev
environment is run under RH 7.3

Everything is fine until you want to add your own programs
or build a new kernel.  You clearly want USB so you are
going to need a version 2.4 kernel.   We do have a sort
of HowTo in the archives for doing that.  As usual, you
have to use the older version of gcc to build it.  Then
you maneuver the resulting kernel into the right place
so PWL will build it into your system.

That's reasonably cool because the kernel is in effect a
statically linked program.

But I bet you will need some other utilities to use with
the USB.  When you compile new programs, you have these
choices:
 - Statically link everthing so it doesn't care what
   version libraries are present on the target. 
 - Build them dynamic and arrange to also install the
   necessary libraries along with the programs.  And
   hope the two lib versions don't get confused.
 - Get a RH6.2 system, build them there, then bring
   the results over to your normal development system
   and turn PWL loose on them.

I did that last one in order to build the latest PHP engine.

My experience is that you can start by building targets, and
"grow into" the more involved stuff as you go along and need
to do more special things.

Hope this provides some elightenment.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] PeeweeLinux + Xwindows booting from Compact Flash
Message-ID: <1061223464.2150.67.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi there,

I am currently working on a project that requires linux (with xwindows
and mozilla/flash) to boot from a 128mb flash card and run on an i486
based 133mhz CPU in under 60 seconds.

PeeweeLinux looks like a possibility, as I see you can add X windows to
it (the only reason i need flash and mozilla is because the embedded
device I am developing for is a touchscreen and the flash will provide a
nice pretty front end for our users).

-	Is Peewee Linux suitable for this development ?
-	What steps would be needed to get a peewee linux based system up
	running ?

If anyone needs any further information about my setup to be able to
help me out just shout and I will provide it. Any advice would be
greatly appreciated as I want to get this system up and running within
two weeks for an upcoming tradeshow we have booked floor space at.

 Flash
Message-ID: <sf40f35d.043@qatech.com>

Hello,

I've been able to boot to X in under 60 seconds and run a GUI application with Peewee. 

I recommend doing the following:

- Develop an application and user interface code using the fltk C++ libraries. Get it working on your development linux machine. Once you like how it runs you can compile it as static, which means it will run on peewee wihtout having to install the libraries on your peewee machine (which can be a pain). The reason I suggest FLTK ist hat it builds really small static executeables. 
- Build a peeweeLinux compact flash card image that boots to X windows. (I have such a thing already I can send to you...)
- So now you have peewee working and an application working (You can develop these in parallel to help with your deadline if you can get someone to help you out). All you should have to do is to copy your statically built FLTK executeable to peewee and it should work well. 

I have a project which should boot automatically to X windows and fire up an application automatically, so if you can get your GUI application running on a development system, you should be all set. Let me know if you wnat the Peewee X windows boot project to get started and I'll email it to you. 

- Depending on what you have installed on peewee, it will boot at different speeds. For a fairly large system, such as with X installed and normal unix utilities, it is probably quickest to boot with a Read only root filesystem with multiple ramdisk in the peewee options. Give it a try and see how it works for you. 

If you really need to use Flash for some reason (I don't recommend it) I am not sure what you will need to do. Mozilla will probably cripple a 486 computer. It'd probably take 60 seconds to run mozilla even after bootup. FLTK stands for "Fast and Light Toolkit" so it should be OK on 486. Your flash card will probably only need to be 16-32MB max.

Ken,

Thanks very much for your information, it has been a great help! Enough
of a help infact for me to decide to switch development from building my
own LFS system ( http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ ) to using
peeweeLinux. I am meeting with our client this morning to talk about
possible changes to the design specification (IE not using mozilla/flash
and using a custom built GUI).

I would love to have a copy of your bootable peeweeLinux X Windows
project, it would be very useful. I am about to leave for this meeting,
but will get back to you later on today privately.

For the lists information, the specification of the hardware that I will
be developing for is here...

Ok meeting over,

As much as would like to code my own GUI using fltk c++, it doesn't fit
in with the product specification. peeweeLinux + xwindows will remain
the base linux system, but the flash GUI aspect of the front-end is one
of the sale-able features, so cannot be changed.

The browser on the peeweeLinux will need to connect to a central web
server which will host the controls. Not just the touchscreen project
will be interfacing with this server (which is already coded) users can
also access it from their desktops etc.

Therefore my final system requires
	-	TCP/IP Networking capability
	-	A flash capable browser (mozilla?)

Can I still meet these requirements using peeweeLinux as the base OS?
They are prepared to bend the 60 second booting time, as I mentioned
this was unrealistic, although keeping boot time down is still of
importance.

Personally I detest flash, however my vote doesn't get very far on this
one, I am just the developer... (/me wonders how many other people have
experienced this before) :)

I'm not familiar with using browsers on peewee. I'd recommend one of the PIII boards running the old version of netscape (4.7 ish??) that comes with Peewee. Then you can use a compatable version of macromedia flash and it will be real fast. Thats probably the quickest and easiest option. Other than that I can't help you there.

I agree, Flash is pretty gross for embedded stuff, and for most things in general. 

Well, good luck.

Mozilla is so huge I won't even put it on my desktop machine.
But there is a browser-only version called Firebird.  
Browser only?  Yes, no page composer, no email client, no newsreader, etc.
And there are other browsers, like Opera.

Flash is a good technology.  Horribly misused 95% of the time.

Ashley,

I have been following the discussion about your project to build a kiosk 
with a web interface for a convention.  I have been working on a similar 
project using PeeWeeLinux, and I think I may be of a little help.

I'm working on a project for my company.  We call it the SolarKiosk.  We 
have some government grant money to build little solar-powered kiosk 
computers out in the desert in Utah.  The kiosks provide weather 
information and water information to mostly farmers who depend very much 
on weather and water information so that they know how much to irrigate 
their crops.  It's called the SolarKiosk because the kiosks will be 
powered by solar panels and batteries.  They each have a low-speed 
wireless internet link, as well.

The project isn't 100% completed yet, but we have a working prototype in 
our office.

I chose to use the PeeWeeLinux distribution as the base operating 
system.  We bought one of those Geode 300X "brick" SBCs because we 
wanted video and sound capabilities on our kiosks.  I installed a 2.4.18 
kernel (using the howto in this mailing-list archive -- big thanks to 
the author!), and instead of running X windows and then a web browser on 
top of that, I found a version of the  Konqueror web browser will run 
without X Windows - using the frame buffer device instead.  This saved a 
lot of hassle and ramdisk space.

The "embedded" Konqueror browser is HTML 4.01 compliant, does CCS, 
JavaScript, and does Gif/Jpeg/Png just like the regular X11 browser 
does.  It also comes with support for a Flash plugin (I couldn't get it 
to compile, though, but I'm sure its very possible .. perhaps I should 
read more in the Konqueror/Embedded newsgroups for directions on how to 
compile it.).  Best of all, the Konq/e browser stripped is just under 3 
megabytes.  Konq/e also has a configure option, where you can specify it 
to run in a Kiosk mode -- fullscreen, without the window resizing, 
menubar, toolbar, navigation bar, etc.  It's exactly what we needed for 
the SolarKiosk.  Konqeuror also is fully keyboard navigatable, so we 
could set up the Kiosk without a mouse and it will still be usable by 
the users.

For the Konqueror browser to work, all I had to do was to install the 
Qt/Embedded libraries.  These take up about 5 megabytes, plus font files 
(which can be from 1 meg to 10 megs, depending on what fonts you want to 
make available for the web browser).

We wanted the SolarKiosk to also be able to run perl programs, so we got 
Perl 5.0005 running.  We even got Perl/Tk running successfully. The 
SolarKiosk has sshd running on it, so you can scp files and ssh into the 
SolarKiosk from remote locations.  The SolarKiosk also has rsync, to 
syncronize files (or the "content") that will display the weather 
information to the kiosk users.

Because the SolarKiosks won't have a very fast internet link, we wanted 
to slowly "trickle" the content and cache it on the SolarKiosk. I 
installed Apache 1.3.27 + PHP 4.3.2 (just under 2 megabytes), so that 
the Konq/E browser points to its own localhost and displays the web 
pages from its own memory.

For the sound, I got the appropriate kernel modules for my soundcard on 
the SBC (soundblaster 2.0 + compatable in my case), and I use the mpg123 
program that comes with PeeWeeLinux.  We would then generate mp3 files 
on a separate machine, and "trickle" mp3 files to the SolarKiosk, so 
when a user clicks on certain pages, the audio bytes can be heard from 
the Kiosk as well as read on the screen.

I used the "autobootx" from ... (I hope I get my credits right) .. was 
it Barry that created that? Anyway, I set it up so that it autoboots the 
Konqeuror Browser in Kiosk mode, pointing to http://localhost/ .

We bought one of those keyboard encoders two weeks ago, too.  With a 
keyboard encoder, you can map a switch or a button to a keyboard key.  
Our SolarKiosk has only three buttons (no keyboard, no mouse), and is 
fully navigatable.  I mapped one pushbutton to tab (for Konq/e to go to 
the next link / page down), another pushbutton to shift+tab (for Konq/e 
to go to the previous link/page up), and the third button to enter 
("click" on the selected link).

The SolarKiosk itself is pretty much complete.  The website and the 
server-side content-generating programs are my current tasks.  The 
website isn't complete, but you're welcome to go see and download  a 
version of the SolarKiosk and try it out on your system.

The website URL is: http://www.picklebone.com/solarkiosk/

If anyone else is interested in this project, please let me know!

Hi there.

Very interesting stuff. Can you point us to where did you found the 
embedded konqueror sources? I'm interested on building on for use with X.

Thanks

Thanks Daniel, thats interesting stuff. Lots of information for me to
consider that is applicable to my project.

Im currently trying to decide which is the best browser to display the
flash GUI :-

-	Firebird
-	Netscape 4.8
-	Konqueror
-	Konqueror/Embedded

Since I am using a low spec system, the most crucial factor is resource
usage, but stability and ease of installation/setup are also important.

Thanks for all the replies, i will let you all know how things progress.

QUOTE FROM REPLY TO ABOVE MAIL
" Check to make sure that you have selected "etc/" under Project File
System --> System
Base --> file system, and also "etc/inittab" under initscripts.  You may 
have selected another package (sysvinit, for example) that requires this 
file. "

I have checked this, under these options it just says 'estimated total 
from selected files 0' even when I choose 'select all files from 
package'. I also tried just using minimal project (to /dev/sda/) , but 
the same errors occur.

When I try and 'Extract File System for Project' it just gives me lots
of 'Not found in Archive' messages for all of the files.

Can anyone see what I am doing wrong here ? Is there any other
information I can provide to aid the problem diagnosis ? Any help would
be appreciated :)

I don't have an answer, but as much as I have been studying (or is
that playing with?) the internals of PeeWeeLinux, maybe this could
help.

This won't necessarily break your system.  I get these a lot and
while it may be my fault, it hasn't hurt.    If there were a 
problem it would show up after you booted and tried to run some
program that needed a particular library.

>************

PeeWeeLinux (PWL) is the Embedded_Build directory and everything
below.  There's a projects directory, and I see you made a project
called bootx.  All the stuff you do happens within the bootx
directory.  If you look in mnt (that's projects/bootx/mnt which
is different from /mnt) what you see there is a replica of
what is supposed to go onto your target.  If it's not there,
it won't be in your target either.

>>Check to make sure that you have selected "etc/" ...

>I have checked this, under these options it just says 'estimated total

That's ok.  If you are selecting directories (and you do have
to sometimes, to ensure that the directories themselves get
created) the directories themselves don't take up any space.
So what you saw is right.


>When I try and 'Extract File System for Project' it just gives me lots
>of 'Not found in Archive' messages for all of the files.

This looks like the first error.  Meaning that you need to get this
fixed first.  This is the step that creates your target's file
tree on project/bootx/mnt

I wonder if you managed to be missing the packages?  I did this once.
Extracting them is supposed to happen automatically the first
time it PWL is run.  I think a few others have managed this stunt
as well.  Have a look in the Embedded_Build/packages directory
and see if you see directories corresponding to PWL choices (I
have about 24 of them).  In each of those directories you 
should see pairs of files named .tar and .list
If you don't, that's the first step.

BTW, 'bzImage-full' is a kernel.  And Kernel is one of the packages.

Thanks Barry,

Well, all the .tar and .list files are there. I agree that the fact that
the file system wont extract is the problem, but can't understand why.
I'm thinking more and more that it is my host development system setup.
I am using Red Hat 9.0, and possibly the reason it will not extract is
due to factors such as incorrect permissions etc. I am currently logging
on as a user, then 'su root' and unpacking in my '/home/user/' directory
before running ./pwlconfig . 

The bootx project has been tested out and works fine on other systems
(Ken, the gentleman who sent me the file bootx.tgz extracted and put to
target flash card with the exact same file to check for me).

/me keeps plugging away :)

Ok,

All the extracted .rpm files that are created in the
Embedded_Build/packages directory when I first run pwlconfig are 10 k
(and empty...), and all the .list files are 0 k. Surely this must be the
problem, the files are not being extracted correctly when pwlconfig is
run for the first time.

What could cause this problem, and how can i fix it ? (i suppose i could
manually extract each .rpm package...)

Good idea but I wouldn't expect root to have any problems with
permissions.  You do have to run it as root.  I tried getting
around that requirment and guess what it got me--no packages! :-)


>All the extracted .rpm files that are created in the

You gave me an idea, and I tried it, and it worked.  Wipe out
the packages directory.  (Or rename it if you are shy).  Make
sure the packages directory does not exist.  When you run
pwlconfig, you will get the "extract packages" prompt again.

Hopefully RH9 rpm isn't broken (but it's only a hope)

The rpm's that are to be extracted are in 
Embedded_Build/src/RPMS/i386
and they should have come straight from the PeeWeeLinux install.

Thanks Barry,

Well I ran the ./pwlconfig on a colleagues machine and it created the
packages directory with correctly sized files. I copied that packages
back to my development machine, and VOILA, now its all working :)

Who knows what caused the auto-extraction to fail on my machine (maybe
something RH9 related?), but at least I am over this stumbling block.

The compact flash I have is now bootable on my target hardware despite
one small error message I did get during extracting the files described
as follows...

*************

ncurses.tar            bootx/ncurses.list                              
tar: usr/bin/clear: Could not create file: File exists

*************

QUOTE : Ncurses (new curses) ... It is a library of functions that
manage an application's display on character-cell terminals.

My system boots fine as mentioned before, but I am having a little
problem getting into X windows (is it related to the ncurses problem?)

It tries and fails to get into X windows 'Cannot Open Mouse (no such
device)' despite XF86Config showing protocol ps/2 and /dev/psaux. There
are no interrupt conflicts and mouse is detected fine in the bios so it
has me a little stuck. Any ideas ?

Getting there, deadline is approaching *gulp*!

HEllo,

Edit the XF86Config file in the project directory. ITs under the "custom" directory in your project. 

Edit etc/X11/XF86Config  for your particular mouse options. By default, the mouse is set up for PS/2 protocol on the /dev/psaux  device. Make sure these things are OK. 

Try doing the following at your prompt:

dmesg | grep Detected

You should see a line saying "Detected PS/2 Mouse" or similar. 

Do a "Alt-F2" or "CTRL-ALT-F2" to get to a terminal if you are stuck in some error state when X fails.

Yep checked these, all is OK.

When I execute this command it shows nothing, just returns me to the
command prompt again. 

On looking in /proc/interrupts there is no entry on IRQ 12, where the
mouse should be assigned. This is despite the fact that the BIOS detects
the mouse on boot-up and initialises. IRQ 12 is not reserved in the
BIOS.

Hi,

Does Adi's Electronics still exist? I have submitted questions on
products using their web form but haven't gotten any response. One of my
questions was how or where do you mount a "3.5" Adapter cfdisk.1c"
module inside a case? I've long forgotten my other question. My goal is
to build some thin client boxes using the mini ITX platform.

Thanks,
Stephen

Sounds like an issue with the 2.2 kernel and your hardware. IF nothing else, see if you can plug in a serial mouse and try that route to get you going until you can debug why the kernel is not cooperating with your PS/2 port.

I agree with your conclusion about kernel/hardware incompatibility. I
don't have the time to upgrade the kernel, so I am just going to press
ahead using a serial mouse as suggested. Fingers crossed I will not run
into a third hardware issue argh! :)

Hi,

	This is just from looking at the site, could be wrong.

	Looks like the one you're after doesn't have any way to plug into a
standard board.

	Howerver, the Plugin CompactFlash to IDE Adapter apparently attaches to the
IDE connector.

	You better check these with adi, though.

	If don't have the pc yet, why not buy one small form factor, they usually
include the cf reader. Try www.advantech.com for starters.
