Hi!

I've got an IBM NetVista 8364 TUS thin client I am trying to get 
PeeWeeLinux to boot on from CF card.
The specs of the client are here :

<http://reviews.cnet.com/NETVISTA_2800_THIN_CLIENT_64MB_TR_8364_TUS/4507-3119_7-776185.html?tag=subnav>(Sorry 
for the CNet link - can't find the IBM specs anymore...)
This is basically a Pentium 266 with 64MB RAM on a custom IBM 
motherboard with integrated SIS graphics chip.

I unfortunately have the Token ring version, but the machine does have a 
PCI slot for an ethernet card.

I've read quite a few IBM FAQ's and deja comments that state it should 
be possible to boot off a
Compact Flash card for this machine (the board has an integrated CF 
slot, and the BIOS recognises a 32MB hard disk
on IDE0 in the BIOS when I plug in my CF card - which is a Sandisk as 
required IBM)

I'm not sure I've built my CF card correctly as I don't get anything 
other than "Operating System not found" displayed by the client.

It's also possible that I need to update the BIOS to a later version (I 
have the server downloads from IBM to do this, but am having difficulty
getting  token ring hardware (without paying an arm and a leg for 
something I want to use once just to flash the BIOS!!))
To update the BIOS requires PIX booting from the IBM tftp server and 
then having the IBM software flash the BIOS.

I have tested this by DD'ing a 1.44" floppy image onto the CF card and 
booting that, but I still get the same error. ("No OS found")

Firstly, has anyone booted the IBM 8364 netvista series from CF card???

Is DD'ing a floppy  image onto a CF card a valid process (I could mount 
the card and see the contents of the image filesystem correctly on my host).

Are CF card images available for download to test my hardware so I can 
rule out PeeWeeLinux configuration problems??

Thanks Heaps in advanve for any pointers or advice!!!!

Michael,

I don't have any experience with you hardware but if it says it
can boot off IDE0 then you ought to be able to get *something*
out of it.

Look at the text of the OS boot failure message carefully.
Also compare to what you see if you pull the CF card out
and try to boot.  Most non-bootable media still has a 
boot program in it that says in effect "Can't boot this".

Is there a BIOS message that shows it detects the flash disk?

Next, dd the first sector of your CF card back off the
card and look at it, and see if it looks like a boot sector.
Or post a hex dump of it if you don't have that experience.

Make sure the IBM really boots that drive as IDE0 and that
you told peeweelinux that it is "hda".  A lot of boards
that have a CF drive use hdc (master drive but second
controller.)  Make sure peewee didn't throw an error,
especially in the lilo installation.

A floppy's boot sector, and a hard drive's boot + partition
table aren't the same.  I don't think the floppy sector
will boot a hard drive but I don't recall trying (now
I'll have to...)

A linux kernel will boot from a floppy if you dd it.  But
again I don't think this would work on a hard drive.

The point I'm trying to make is to find out what happens
in that first access to IDE0.  If that doesn't happen,
then it matters little how your Linux was built.

Barry
