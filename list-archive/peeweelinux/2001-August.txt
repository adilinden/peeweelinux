Subject: Telnet problem
Message-ID: <5009AD9521A8D41198EE00805F85F18FD075A8@SEMBO111>

Hi,

I'm using pwlconfig 0.61 to create an embedded linux version and it's
working well (nice distribution !) except for the telnet that gives me this
error message when i try to use it:

"telnet: error in loading shared libraries: libutil.so.1: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory"

I've included many network packages but this one is probably dependent of a
specific package that I did not include. Maybe you could help me with this.

I would also like to install a ftp deamon and I didn't find one with PeeWee
Linux. Is there any one that I missed and if not, does someone know a small
one that works fine with PeeWee?

Thanks

Hi,
 
I'm trying to develop a Linux-based system on a Disk On Chip (8Mb).
 
I've got several problems, and although I've read your mailing list
archive, I didn't find a great solution.
 
I'm using PeeWeeLinux 0.61.0 distribution.
I build my file system (with DOC driver included as module or as static
in the kernel : both don't work) and put it on the DiskOnChip (by
replacing lilo with doc-lilo in the pwl-target-load script).
I manage to boot on the DOC, but the system is then bloked while trying
to mount the root partition.
 
It says something like: VFS unable to mount root partition on device
03:02.
 
 
Do you know the problem or at least could you answer to the following
questions:
 
1)       Is it possible to put all the file system directly on the Disk
On Chip target ?
2)       Is it necessary to use doc-lilo (and a special lilo.conf file)
instead of lilo in the pwl_target_load script ?
3)       In the mailing list archive, some say it is necessary to first
put everything on ide partition and then put everything on DOC ?
4)       On the web site, it is written: " Currently the loading of
target devices directly attached to the development system are
supported. These include floppy drives, IDE hard drives, scsi hard
drives, M-Systems Disk-On-Chip and CompactFlash devices.".
So what's the best method to load the file system on the DiskOnChip
target ?
 
 
Thanks very much for your answer !

Hello Guillaume,
    Oddly enough, I found myself in your exact same
situation tonight. I am using a doc system as well,
with the target being an uncompressed ext2 partion on
ramdisk. 

    I was able to get around your particular problem
by creating an msys subdirectory in my
/project/minimal/mnt/dev directory.

    It seems that the portion of the script that
creates the boot device directory structure does not
create multi-level /dev entries. So you may be seeing
cp error messages when your run "load target"

   You may be able to do this with the custom files
option I did it by editing the script file that
creates these directory entries.

   Also make sure that the doc driver is loaded, i am
using a modular driver so i had to modify the linuxrc
in the initrd to load the driver before attempting to
mount the root partition.

   I myself am having trouble with finding init. My
root partition seems to boot fine , but i get 
"Kernel Panic: No INIT found" I suppose for some
reason, the system can't read my root partition.
   
   A curious item, I noticed that for uncompressed
ext2 partitions booting from lilo, the linuxrc script
in the initrd copies the root partition from the
source partion on the flash to /dev/ram2, but the
fstab entry created points / to /dev/ram0. I don't
think this is my problem , but it seems sort of odd.
   
- Tim

Hi, 

The solution for your telnet problem is that you didn't include the 
libutil.so.1. You can find this package in Shell_Librairies / Glibc / (I 
think...)


For you ftp daemon, I'm having the same problem.
If you find a small good one, I will be happy to have news about it...

Thanks

Hi, 


I'm using pwlconfig 0.61 to create an embedded linux version and it's 
working well (nice distribution !) except for the telnet that gives me this 
error message when i try to use it: 


"telnet: error in loading shared libraries: libutil.so.1: cannot open shared 
object file: No such file or directory" 


I've included many network packages but this one is probably dependent of a 
specific package that I did not include. Maybe you could help me with this. 


I would also like to install a ftp deamon and I didn't find one with PeeWee 
Linux. Is there any one that I missed and if not, does someone know a small 
one that works fine with PeeWee? 


Thanks

Hi,

I believe there is a netkit-ftp package which also includes the ftp
daemon.

Subject: Can mount ramdisk root (/) ; Can't find /sbin/init
Message-ID: <20010824051003.72798.qmail@web13509.mail.yahoo.com>

Howdy.
   4 nights and nothing to show for it but a greatly
enhanced knowledge of the linux boot process... and
yet.....
   I am using a DOC system with an uncompressed ext2
ramdisk and initrd.
   When I boot up , 
       initrd runs (which installs my DOC driver),
       the /dev/msys/fla2 gets successfully
transferred to /dev/ram2,
       the kernel reports a successful mount of the
root filesystem,
       The kernel reports it can't find init.

   I also have a development hda on this system and if
I pass the "root=/dev/hda1 init=/bin/sh" command to
the kernel/bootloader it comes up fine. I can even
mount /dev/ram2 and run /ram/mount/point/sbin/init.

   Any ideas? 
   I am getting a psychic vibration from the ramdisk
configuration. Could this be a library issue? 

Thanks
-Tim

Subject: getting started question
Message-ID: <3B8D4C1B.6060607@fonner.net>

Hello, I am a little new to the world of embedded linux so go easy on 
me.  Anyways I am having some trouble getting started.  I extracted the 
files as root under /root/Embedded_Build.  I go into this directory and 
type ./pwlconfig
and all it shows is
..
and then it just sits there.  Any idea what going on?  I tried 
downloading it twice.  The first time I downloaded the whole thing..  
peeweelinux-0.61.0-src.tar.gz
Second time I downloaded..  peeweelinux-0.61.0-bin.tar.gz
Same result both times.
FYI...This is on a fresh installation of Redhat 7.1

Thanks,
Kevin

Hi,

You need to have ncurses installed on the RedHat 7.1 box...
