Subject: Telnetd and Read-Only root partition
Message-ID: <01090617500603.01042@gsisteron.local.com1.fr>

Hi,

I've just tried to mount my root partition in read-only mode.
I resolve all the problems it envolves except the telnetd problem:

When the root partition is in Read/Write Mode, everything works fine.
But when it is in Read-Only Mode, the telnetd daemon does'nt work at all.
It hangs up.

Did someone had the same problem and found the solution ?
(Maybe a /dev/ttyp to link, or something like that)

Thanks very much

Hi,

When mounting root read-only you still need some things writable. Like tty
devices amongst things. Do you have a partition or ramdisk mounted which
is read-write? The devices should go there...

TTYL,
Adi

Yes i've got a partition that is read-write.
But i'd like to know exactly which device to put on the read-write partition
in order to have exactly the things needed on the read-write partition.

Do you know what tty is it ?
ttyp ?

Thanks

Guillaume

I haven't done that in a while. I am not sure.

On kernels that aren't using "Unix98 PTYS", I believe it's /dev/ttyp0,
ttyp1, ... etc.

Subject: 2 DiskOnChip on the same card
Message-ID: <01091110502400.01004@gsistero.local.com1.fr>

Hi,

I'm trying to use two DiskOnChip on my card with Linux system.

If there is only one, everything is ok and PeeWeeLinux works fine.

But if I put 2 DOC, the system doesn't want to boot:
In fact, it seems that it doesn't manage to mount the root partition:

"Unable to mount root partition on device 03:02"

Is there anyone that managed to boot with 2 DOC on the same card.

Thanks

Yes, it is /dev/ttyp0.

But I've got another problem: once a telnet session is began, I can't do a su 
command:
There are two error messages in /var/log/messages:

login: unable to determine TTY name, got /dev/UNKNOWN

and

login: initgroups failed for user `admin`


Any suggestion ?

Thanks

Guillaume
