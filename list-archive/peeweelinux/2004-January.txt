Subject: [Peeweelinux] RH62 compat. question
Message-ID: <038601c3d344$c43c7840$e001a8c0@cuba>

Hi,
I'm learning how to compile apps for use in PWL systems.  My host is running
RH8 but I've got the compat-* RPMs from RH73, so I have (in theory) the
ability to build RH62-compatible apps.

My question is, is there any steps other than just running the
/usr/i386-glibc21-linux/bin/i386-glibc21-linux-env.sh script before
compiling the applications?  When I take this script into my shell with ".
/usr/i386-glibc21-linux/bin/i386-glibc21-linux-env.sh", and then do
configure/make/etc, the resulting binaries are still linked against the
glibc from RH8.  Are there additional env. variables to make gcc/ld find the
older libraries?

Also, I'm using the "kgcc" compiler, FWIW.

If anyone could fill me in on what I need to do to get these apps. linked
agains glibc 2.1, it would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,
Jonathan

Hi Jonathan,

I had similar problems, although I was using RH7.2.  Take a look at:

Hmmm.  I'm doing it right but it doesn't link properly.  The two variables
defined by the script are set properly and exported, but they don't appear
to affect anything.  BTW, I'm trying to compile nptd-4.2.0.

After playing around, I found that if I set LDFLAGS to "-Xlinker -m -Xlinker
elf_i386_glibc21" (which should accomplish the same results with ld that
setting LDEMULATION does), it does "something" different because linking now
fails when linking the ntpd binary, whereas before it linked it successfully
to the RH8 glibc.

I'll play with it some more, but it's kinda frustrating for now.

thanks for any more tips,
Jonathan

Message-ID: <3309.67.95.2.181.1074217251.squirrel@www.thepennocks.com>

I just got my system booting off my compact flash card, and the console
displays 'pc 104 login:'.
I can type anything at this point, and when I hit 'enter', I get the
response 'Login Incorrect', and am prompted again for a username.
I have edited the passwd file to remove the passwords, but I never get to
the point where I am prompted for one.
Does anyone have any ideas?
I'm new to the embedded side of linux, and after much work am so excited to
actually finally see a login prompt.  I believe if I can get over this
hurdle, my project may sail along fairly smoothly.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] about autologin again
Message-ID: <Law15-F113uR8bAYkWA00044edd@hotmail.com>

I am a newbie in Embedded Linux world.

I run minimal example nicely on a pc/104 via CompactFlash. Thank you for 
this wonderful tool!


Now i want to enable the Autologin ability to my system.

I checked the mailing list. And tried to modify the /etc/inittab file from 
one instruction.

Create a file named autologin.c add this to the file: int main () { execlp 
("login", "login", "-f", "root", 0); }

Now gcc -o autologin autologin.c Now cp autologin /sbin Now edit  
etc/inittab file, look for the line that looks like this: 
1:345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1 and change to 
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty -n -l /sbin/autologin 38400 tty1


but the system is still asking for password!

Do you have any other approach to do Autologin? How about by "tinylogin" in 
./pwlconfig
and can you tell me? Or some one would send me the bootx.gz file?

Thank you very much.

I've created an example project that Autoboots, and also fires up a generic X windows for any machine. 

It sounds like you are happy with the minimal setup, so all you need is how to autologin.

Basically, you need to add these two lines to your inittab file:

#Runlevel 4 is for auto login user. 
#It can also be used to start X if "startx" is put in ~/.bashrc
id:4:initdefault:

#if in runlevel 4 change to autologin user
1:4:respawn:su -l autologin

Put any startup stuff in the "autologin" users bashrc. 

Hope this helps...
~Ken

Did you try the PWL default root passwd of "redhat"?

Your passwd file is probably getting over-written by one of the PWL scripts.
Search the list archives and/or the scripts themselves to track it down.

good luck,
Jonathan

I 'figured' out my problem(s).
I was using a debian development system and things just didn't work right.
I rebuilt the system as a RH6.2 box, and voila! all was well.
I now have a system that boots off my CF card and runs like it should.
Now to write the software that I want to run on it.

Thanks for all the ideas and help.

I have all kinds of places I can make this available for easy 
downloading; if you or Ken wants to upload not only the bootx.tgz sample 
project, but also a quick readme I'd be happy to host on our anon FTP 
server.

Just upload to ftp.fluid.com /incoming, then drop me an email. I'll move 
it to a home in /outgoing and we're done.

Hello, I've added this to Troy's Server. 

I tried to create a folder for it, but botched it up a bit. The "bootx.tgz" and "README" files in the incoming folder belong to the project. 

If you would be kind enough to put this in a accessable directory and post a link to the list, I would appreciate it. 

Thanks,

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Project: Linux powered picture frame. PWL a good match?
Message-ID: <A7D7EEA8-4C21-11D8-8854-000A95A08488@shreve.net>

Hi all,

    I am in the process of making my own digital picture frame using an 
old laptop (IBM Thinkpad X20).  Here's basically what I want the system 
to do on bootup:

	1 - Load the system into RAM
	2 - Initialize the WiFi LAN card (Prism based) and get a DHCP address 
(or static, not too important which)
	3 - Mount an NFS partition
	4 - Start a slideshow using 'zgv' and SVGAlib reading jpg's from the 
NFS mounted dir
	5 - Continue step 4 until the universe collapses.

The Thinkpad has been fitted with a 128MB CF card and adaptor. It is 
successfully booting to a DOS prompt currently.  I have another X20 
laptop which I plan to use as a development system for this project. It 
is ideally suited IMHO since it has Redhat 9 installed and a built in 
CF slot.

I dont know if PWL is really suited for this or not.  I cant find much 
about it's WiFi PCMCIA support in the archives.  My other idea is to 
strip down a RH9 install and use a heavily stripped down kernel.  I am 
reading the bootdisk HOW-TO and it doesnt seem extremely complicated, 
but I dont want to re-invent the wheel or delay the project so long I 
forget about it (like a lot of my projects end up <sigh>).

What do you all recommend?

-Ken

Well, my 2 cents ...

I tried to get pwl to work as a similar platform and eventually gave up. I
ended up doing a fresh install of RH 9 and stripping it back. I need to
strip more or figure out pwl better, but for now it works.

The pros:

It is quick and relatively simple to do
Easy to replicate if you need to start all over
I have it all fitting on a 128 mb CF card (I have perl, apache and a few
other RPMs installed too, you can probably fit it on a smaller one)

The cons: 
You need at least 500 MB to do a minimal install from the RH 9 CDs.
There are a lot of superfluous programs and files installed.


What I did was to install everything to a 512 mb CF, strip it down and then
cp everything to a smaller CF, run lilo on it and swap it out.

 
All The Best,

re-invent the wheel or delay the project so long I forget about it (like a
lot of my projects end up <sigh>).

What do you all recommend?

Could this be done on 2 different computers?
ie, install RH on a HD from CDs, strip it down, then copy everything to a 
CF card (dd?).
A second computer (no CD or HD) will boot off of the CF.

...I guess that is the way PWL does it... build a directory structure with 
the stripped-down
OS in it and load that onto the CF.

Heya Ken,

I reformatted your README for linebreaks (so it's pretty when viewed in 
Mozilla), added your email address. It's home is:

   ftp://ftp.fluid.com/outgoing/pwl/bootx/
   http://ftp.fluid.com/outgoing/pwl/bootx/

When I get time, I think I may throw up some of my custom stuff (don't 
hold your breath ;) ).

Yes. But.. There can be issues if the hardware is not the same. I happen to
be making a few of my devices and used one to set it up, so the hardware is
the same for all of them.
 
dd for some reason did not work for me with the CF. I have in the past used
it with HDs.

So long as you have all the right drivers on the CF, you should be fine tho.
I would say, install RH9 onto a HD in the laptop, strip it down, then put it
on the CF in the laptop and remove the HD.

 
All The Best,

Subject: [Peeweelinux] My little poor experience
Message-ID: <Law15-F58FHmxYqMgzB000011be@hotmail.com>

Thanks for the great help from Ashley Rolleston and Ken Emmons.

Here is my little poor experience :-)  :

Now i am using a PCM5335-B10 PC/104 board as platform. and it has a 
CompactFlash socket, treats it as HardDisk.

Of course, I am using SanDisk 64MB CF card. My expericence is that don't use 
a flash multi-reader, using a single CF card reader ( SDDR-91 USB reader ) 
makes things easier.

RedHat 9 didn't support PeeWeeLinux well, it always made installation 
failure. The Redhat 7 is a very nice version for PeeWee.

Powered by PeeWeeLinux, the development became really easy. As i got 
bootx.tgz, I only tried twice of installation and then the system could run 
on the board!

As PCM5335-B10 is a poewerful PC/104 board, and it supports CF strongly,  I 
used "Read-Write as root on Single partition", and boots fast.

Now, here are some questions again:

Teacher asked me do a application on it. And the application have to use 
Imlib and GTK+, since the CF card still a lot space left (about 45MB), i 
wanna these libraries included on my target Linux.

I tried application once, the error is:

libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0
libgdk_imbib.so.1

Can anybody tell me how to do it? Thank you :-)

If you're just messing around (ie, not building a real device for 
deployment) then the easiest thing to do is find yourself a RedHat 6.2 
machine, and get the libraries for <anything> off of it. PeeWee is 
basically a super-mini RH62 machine.

So you mean that: I compiled my application on RedHat6.2 , and just copy 
those needed libraries from it to my target CF card, right? they are all 
under /usr/lib ?

Yes, exactly. You can use ldd ("ldd /path/to/file") to have the system
show you what libraries it's linked to, and use that list to copy to your
CF device. Use the PWL custom files feature and let PeeWee do the work for
you.

Pay extra care when copying, so that you get the symlinks and such
(typically libfooo.so is a symlink to libfoo.so.3.2 (eg)).

As you get more familiar with PWL and how it works, you can build packages
instead and have them show up in the package management section just like
everything else.

Subject: [Peeweelinux] Still having compilation problems
Message-ID: <013c01c3e52e$a5e7e400$e001a8c0@cuba>

Hi,
I hate to beg, but I'm still having problems compiling apps. for PWL using
my RH8 host system.  I have read the archives about the compat-* RPMs and I
have them and am using them properly.

Would some kind soul be able to help me out?  I'm really stuck.  I cannot
get anything to compile that doesn't end up linked against the RH8 glibc.

My host systems are running in VMWare, FWIW.  In desperation, I even created
a RH6.2 virtual machine, but the 2.2 kernels don't have good USB support.
This has left me with no way to write to CF cards from the RH6.2 VM.  Hence,
I would really like to make this work under RH8.

Please send me e-mail directly (off-list) if you can help:
jonathan@sprintmail.com

thanks!
Jonathan

Try using RH72 or RH73 -- that's my build system, and has good enough 
support to write to the USB CF writer. The compat-* packages work as 
expected and everything is fine.

RH8+ completely changed things around, it's not surprising the older 6.2 
based PWL won't compile correctly. Someday someone will take up the 
project of revamping PWL into this century.
