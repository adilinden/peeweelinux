<PRE>Hi

I am also interested in such a product, but with a few additions.  I would like to build one with 3 cards, 2 for 802.11b, one for 802.11a, and then a relay radio to act as the backbone between nodes.

I am thinking that it would be great if it could also cache web pages as this would speed things up.  Then my friends could share a T1 connection in our area.

This is probably more processing power than the orinoco solution has, maybe an AMD Athlon is needed.

One of the challenges is the same that Adi ran into - heat - only my problem is worse, as I want to put it outside in CA, where it is 45 C in the summer.

I think it may be easier to get drivers for proxim, as they sell a driver development kit, and seem open to working with people.  I live only 30 Km from their office in CA

Thanks

Harry Niedecken
