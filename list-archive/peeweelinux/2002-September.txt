Hello, Can anyone tell me how to add packages in peewee... For example:
a small binary rpm package like x3270 or
tn5250 ..Is there a utility to do this ?
Your Help Is appreciated

>From what I can ascertain, peewee works from rpm's.  I do know
(because I have notes) that when peewee is first brought up,
it unpacks the rpms from a certain directory, and then builds
tar files which it stores in the packages directory.  I don't
know what happens if you add another rpm, whether it "knows"
and offers to convert it, whether you have to find this
operation on the menu, or whether it's a manual task.  One
of us should try it and find out :)

With packages, Adi cautions us to make sure they come from
the same RH6.2 system that peewee comes from, so that your
program will find the libraries it needs.  Other fiddling
may be required since peewee packages were built with some
unneeded features left out...so the program might not work.

The nice thing is that packages put in this way are automatically
recognized and show up in the menu just like the rest of 'em.

There is another way to include programs and files outright.
By building into directory called "/root/custom" you can
have files just copied into the target system and if there
are no issues with the result then they are ready to go.  This
works for things that don't have many files.   There are menu
options that let you collect and select the custom files. 

Hope this helps somehow.

As far as I know, the kernel is a static build binary. It does not depend
on any particular libraries at runtime. So it doesn't really matter which
libraries were installed on the system the kernel was build on.

When it comes to applications this is different. It is certainly possible
to build a statically compiled binary using any libraries of your choice
and it will run on PeeWeeLinux. Being statically compiled it won't require
any libraries to be present at runtime.

If you build a dynamically linked library it is advisable to match the
libraries as build time with the libraries at runtime. The binary require
whatever libs is was linked against at runtime.

I hope this makes sense...

Message-ID: <000001c25488$ee12f360$8001a8c0@san.rr.com>

I moved my project from my 386SX to my Pentium Laptop because I was having
memory leaks.  I recompiled the kernel to add PCMCIA and I removed all the
network card drivers.  When rc.pcmcia is called from sysinit during the boot
up process it fails. I think that it is failing because sysinit does not
pass the 'start' directive.  I added it and it still does not work.    I can
successfully start rc.pcmcia at the command line.  Anyone have any ideas?

There are two other fails that I have seen.  The first is a 'grep -F'.  When
I look at the web page for busybox there isn't an '-F' listed, nor is there
one listed on grep on my Redhat 7.2 box.  The other problem is in the last
line of the script, I get a 'Syntax error: Bad substitution'

Thanks,

Indeed, as Adi mentions, static linking against my host system's libraries
makes my application run fine on PeeWee with kernel 2.2.17.

I would like the system to boot without giving me a login and password

I also would like to do away with the kernel boot messages.  I know how to

lilo.conf in a normal linux file system and then run lilo to get rid of the

Message-ID: <sd7756e6.055@qatech.com>

Hello,

A while back I did a project that autoboots into a pre-defined user login and starts up the X window system. If you simply download the project from the peewee contributed folder on the server you can take a peak at what I did. I think the key files should be in the "custom" folder of my project under /etc/inittab and also the dotfiles in the autologin user's home directory. Also take a look at the /etc/passwd file for the user creation. I am pretty sure the launching of X gets done in the "autologin" users' bash startup, so you could modify that and be golden if you don't require X support. 

Please give any suggestions or changed scripts if you don't like what I've done.

~Ken

I "grepped grep" and found this, on a RH7.3 system.

  Fgrep is the same as grep -F.

  -F, --fixed-strings
         Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, sepa-
         rated  by  newlines, any of which is to be matched.
         -P, --perl-regexp Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regu-
         lar expression.

I'd be surprised if these were "just added" but the man page does
say Jan 2002, so it could be.

Here is another trick for strange messages from scripts:

  sh -x pcmcia

will echo everything going in and out of the script so you can
see the command that caused the 'Syntax error: Bad substitution'
error.

we can simple toss out the rh 6.2 grep and replace it with older version of

Message-ID: <OF77860AA5.A4847C62-ON4A256C30.00121889@jupiters.com.au>

Hi all,

just wondering if someone could confirm something for me.

I have modified (butchered is probably the correct term) some of Adis'
peewee scripts to create some extra load options so that peewee
creates/populates some partitions etc. that are specific to a project I am
working on.

in the <peewee_path>/Embedded_Build/scripts directory there is a
pwl_target_functions script that contains a function called
func_rd_fstab_ro_root_rd
which creates the /etc/fstab entry for the project option that allows you
to create a ro root partition with multiple ramdisks.

now in the original pwl_target_functions that ships with peewee, the line
marked with a <<------- below reads:
${rd_boot}2       /            ext2    defaults,ro

I think it should read as below. The root partition is definitely the first
partition. Anyone else come across this ?

######################################################################
#
# func_rd_fstab_ro_root_rd
#
# This function creates the fstab file for the read-only root target
# layout. It contains multiple partitions.
#

func_rd_fstab_ro_root_rd () {
    cat <<-EOF
        ${rd_boot}1       /            ext2    defaults,ro        <<-------
        /dev/ram2       /dev         ext2    defaults
        /dev/ram3       /etc         ext2    defaults
        /dev/ram4       /home        ext2    defaults
        none            /proc        proc    defaults
EOF
}

It's no big deal, just took me 1/2 hour to work out what was going on when
mount reported / being mounted on /dev/hdc2 and /dev/hdc2/ only having
a/home filesystem :)

anyway, hope this stops someone else from doubting their sanity :)
Happy PeeWeeing.


Delaney.

Message-ID: <20020910104726.D26223@leif.octopusmanor>

Background: I'm trying to put Pee Wee on Norand 6110 and 6100 handhelds 
(they are like the ones UPS guys use) so that I can add them to our store 
of available devices (a HOWTO will be coming when I have them working). My 
build environment is a Red Hat 7.2 / 2.4.17 setup with an ISA PCMCIA 
bridge. I'm using regular 256MB PCMCIA Sandisk flash cards. I've got the 
pwlconfig script loading fine onto the target hardware and believe the 
custom kernel script is working as well. In my build script I've tried to 
include syslog and turn on as much logging as possible but may have 
screwed that up. 

Here goes:

1). (Easy/Dumb) The 6110 starts up and then immediately shuts off, 
possibly due to a power issue. Attaching it to the docking station results 
in bringing up the lilo boot menu, and pressing return loads the kernel 
and gets it to a screen with a bunch of startup and routing (which is 
strange because I've not installed any networking either in the kernel or 
the packages) information but it halts there with no login prompt. I'm 
guessing it's getting to a serial console? but don't really know. It's 
probably worth noting that it does this regardless of what drive I set the 
"boot device on target system" to be (I've tried hdc, hde, hdf so far), 
which is weird. 	When I take the PCMCIA cards out and put them back 
in my host computer after having done that the /var/messages "file" is not 
a file and is not readable. For starters, if there is any trick to getting 
regular bootup information viewable after a boot I'd sure love to hear 
about it.

2). (Intermediate) The 6100 has a dos 5.x ROM, so I think I have to use 
loadlin as my bootloader: when I try to use the FAT 16 / ramdisk setup, 
the unit won't seem to recognize the partition as bootable. Has anyone 
used loadlin with pee wee? I looked at the FAT 12 partition that the 
script is creating for the booting off of and it looks like something 
similar is going on, but I think the norand hardware needs an autoexec.bat 
file in order to get loadlin working.

	Thanks in advance for any help, and thanks in general for all your 
work previously. I have benefitted tremendously from looking at the 
archives.

Have I got this right?  Your host is RH 7.2  Your target is peewee
with the 6.2 packages, but you have a custom kernel that's 2.4.17

syslog is on my to-learn list.

I would think it would go to a serial console (1) if you told it to,
or (2) if it couldn't find the native (?) console.  Since you see 
all those messages it must be that it knows how to talk to the
native console (an LCD screen?)

>if there is any trick to getting regular bootup information viewable

There is a line in the scripts that checks for the existence of a
file /etc/boot.silent and it looks like it would send output to
/var/log/boot, otherwise the screen...That silent file doesn't
appear so it should go to the screen.   Of course that is 
for the init scripts that run after the kernel has come up.
I did put an 'echo "hi world" ' in one of the init scripts and
it does indeed show up on my screen.    Now that I've looked
at what it actually does, maybe I should try creating the
quiet file and see what I get...

Which part of the sequence is missing?

In the beginning I was able to boot my system using loadlin.  What I
was doing was making a "floppy" (actually writing the fat12 image
to a hard drive partition).  The resulting syslinux.cfg file has
all the parameter information you need to construct a loadlin command.
You put the kernel image and the ramdisk image where you want to
boot from and those filenames are the ones you use with loadlin.
I haven't figured out what the other target image generating options
in peewee do; unfortunately I don't know of any documentation about 
that.  All I can do is select one of the Target image choices, let 
it make it, and then inspect the results on a running system.

I don't usually offer such dubious help, but it's pretty quiet
here otherwise.  Hope it helps.

The only thing that I have in the /var/log directory is the wtmp file, 
which is empty. This is probably my main problem, without feedback I don't 
really know where to look...

Any little bit, this was much appreciated. I hadn't thought to fool around 
with the syslinux.cfg file, I'll definitely try that out. And if I figure 
out anything about the syslog files I'll definitely pass it on. Thanks 
again,

Message-ID: <sd7f0b21.036@qatech.com>

It seems to me that you have a couple of issues with this embedded board. 

I would first try to bypass the DOS ROM if at all possible and try to boot natively off of the CF card. This is the intended way for peewee to boot. The stuff for Syslinux within the peewee project is intended to be installed on the same disk as the rest of the system, where what you are describing is using syslinux in a DOS ROM to boot Linux residing on another disk. 

I know that embedded hardware at this scale can get pretty strange and proprietary, so you might want to check things such as can the motherboard in this device boot directly off of the CF card, is it really a CF card and not a Disk On Chip, etc etc. I could even imagine that the card has some kind of flash storage that linux doesn't have drivers built for it and it uses some kind of  BIOS code in order to make it work in DOS, similar to a SCSI or Promise card BIOS extension. But now when you boot linux the kernel cannot load, or has no idea of how to mount the root filesystem, etc. 

I'm not saying this is the problem, but its a possibilty that there is something like this going on. 

I have also had problems witht he 2.4 kernels and power management on some motherboards (media GX on an old compaq),  so there might be something going on there.

Have I got this right?  Your host is RH 7.2  Your target is peewee
with the 6.2 packages, but you have a custom kernel that's 2.4.17

syslog is on my to-learn list.

I would think it would go to a serial console (1) if you told it to,
or (2) if it couldn't find the native (?) console.  Since you see 
all those messages it must be that it knows how to talk to the
native console (an LCD screen?)

>if there is any trick to getting regular bootup information viewable

There is a line in the scripts that checks for the existence of a
file /etc/boot.silent and it looks like it would send output to
/var/log/boot, otherwise the screen...That silent file doesn't
appear so it should go to the screen.   Of course that is 
for the init scripts that run after the kernel has come up.
I did put an 'echo "hi world" ' in one of the init scripts and
it does indeed show up on my screen.    Now that I've looked
at what it actually does, maybe I should try creating the
quiet file and see what I get...

Which part of the sequence is missing?

In the beginning I was able to boot my system using loadlin.  What I
was doing was making a "floppy" (actually writing the fat12 image
to a hard drive partition).  The resulting syslinux.cfg file has
all the parameter information you need to construct a loadlin command.
You put the kernel image and the ramdisk image where you want to
boot from and those filenames are the ones you use with loadlin.
I haven't figured out what the other target image generating options
in peewee do; unfortunately I don't know of any documentation about 
that.  All I can do is select one of the Target image choices, let 
it make it, and then inspect the results on a running system.

I don't usually offer such dubious help, but it's pretty quiet
here otherwise.  Hope it helps.

I am having problems being able to ping my machine.
I have read and re-read some of the previous archives and I still can't get
my 
network card seen on my PeeWee build.

I am using a m-sys DOC 2000 with the MTD kernel support.  I have made
my build image and have put my custom files and apps onto the build.
I am also using kernel 2.4.18.  The system boots fine into my DOC and the 
file system looks fine and my app works except the networking part does not.
I have put my own custom ifcfg-eth0 file into the /etc/config location and
when 
the system boots and I go look at the file it has the correct information in
it, but 
I cannot ping the system from another computer.

Just to let you know I can see the system if I boot from the HD into my
installed
Linux Red Hat 7.3 version with the same ifcfg-eth0 and hosts files I am
trying to use
with PeeWee.  I can ping the system fine when I am booted into this system.

One things that I have done to try to get this to work:
Rebuilt the kernel so that my NIC is embedded into the kernel and not a
module,  but after 
building and placing my bzImage under /boot is there anything else to do.
Shouldn't the system
find the ethernet card and use the config files and initialize my card??

Or what about insmod or modules???

I would appreciate any HELP!!!

Most likely, your system is not loading the driver module for your network
card. PWL will not do this automatically as a normal linux system will. To
test, just execute the command
	insmod <yournicmodule>

then do an
	lsmod

to see if your module is loaded correctly. If that works, add the "insmod
<yournicmodule>" command to the rc.modules file in the /etc directory of
your PWL build and it should load when your system boots.

good luck

You would enter the command
	insmod 8139too
to load your network driver. If you are receiving errors regarding
unresolved symbols, then your driver is searching for another library or
driver that it can't find.

If you do an
	nm 8139too.o
command, you should be able to determine what symbols are unresolved. It
could be the way your driver is compiled, whether its static compiled or
dynamic.

Hi

    Just getting started with PeeWee Linux.  I am trying to build the
kernel for a remote machine on a host machine which is running RedHat
Linux.  Using pwlconfig everything went fine until I went to extract
file system for the target.  pwlconfig tried to overwrite files on the
host in boot, /lib,... I must have missed setting something up.  Any
suggestions?

Ouch!!

What I'm guessing you need to do is to go under "Configure Target 
Hardware" and scroll down to the target device. If you're using an ISA 
PCMCIA adaptor, you probably need /dev/hde as your "Target Device". I'm 
guessing it's probably set to /dev/hda (or, if you're using SCSI /dev/sda).

Hopefully, with time and patience you can get up to the area where I'm 
stuck.... ;)

Hello,
I am new to pwl and am trying to shrink down an existing RH 7.2 project to run on a CF.  I am able to create basic distros on the CF and boot from them fine. Problem is I am trying to add apache (apache-1.3.20-16.i386.rpm) and others to my project. This is what I have done:

- log in as root
- copied the apache rpm file into RPMS directory.
- run pwlconfig->Manage Package Files

When I try to extract a binary, I see the rpm in the list and I select it. It comes back saying package was extracted. However there are no *.tar or *.list files created anywhere for apache.

When I try to extract ALL binaries, it runs thru them all (including apache) and does create a *.tar and *.list file in the Deamons directory, but "tar tvf" is empty and the list file is zero size.

What am I doing wrong?
Thanks,
Bob

I have had that same problem, and it was the version of the rpm binary.
peewee uses it's own rpm binary (from rh 6.2).

test your rpm file with that rpm binary and find out if it can open it. if
not, get your own rpm binary. I also once replaced peewees rpm binary with a
simlink to my normal rpm binary, and everything worked, but that's probably
not such a good idea... adi ?

That problem was caused by rpm. I think there were some changes in later 
versions of rpm. The quick fix at the time was to use the specific rpm 
version that was known to work. This is the solution for RedHat 6.x

Having said that, I don't think the RedHat 7.x binary rpms work with 
older rpm versions. Not sure about that, though. Never tried RedHat 7.x 
rpms myself just because of the issues involved with different glibc 
versions.

Hi,
I'm trying to create a CF based distro based on the latest pwl. I am able to create a "minimal" project and have it boot fine. Now I'm trying to add more functions like telnet, and various utilities which I add to minimal. I am using the "full" kernel. Just cannot seem to get past or understand this when booting:

INIT: version 2,78 booting
INIT: cannot execute "/rc.init"
INIT: entering runlevel: 3
INIT cannot execute "/etc/rcS"
INIT: Id "1" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes

INIT: Id "2" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes

INIT: Id "3" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes

INIT: Id "4" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes

INIT: no more processes left in this runlevel



I am using an uncompressed root with a single ramdisk. If I mount the CF and look at it, rc.init and rcS are both there and appear normal. I'm about to start removing packages one by one until it works, but I'm stumped!



Any thoughts?

Bob

Hi Bob,
Firstly check your prepared project such as your etc
directory.
Then manipulate your inittab file which is in your
etc(in your project of course) directory and disable
mgettys and write ash or bash(which you seleceted
before) there by this way you will pass the warnings
and you can check your project.
Did you select sysklogd(or such as this I can't
remember full name of this program) which is in system
deamons.
Did you select mgetty?
Control them I think the problem is one of them.
