<PRE>Hi Ricardo,
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another issue is libnsl. This is necessary to run java, and isn't included
</I>&gt;<i> in peewee, so you have to add it as a custom file. the library version of
</I>&gt;<i> recent distributions (GBLIC2_2) is different from peewee (GBLIC2_1), so you
</I>&gt;<i> probably won't be able to copy it from your desktop, but at least in RH7.2
</I>&gt;<i> there's a directory with compatibility libs and you can just copy it from
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>
Aha!  Very good, I had thought I needed to rebuild an entire glibc-2.1 
in order to get this, but I'll just try grabbing it from a RH62 
compatible set of libraries. Nice tip, thanks!

&gt;<i> One issue I'm pursuing is that I want to mount the filesystem readonly,
</I>&gt;<i> would that interest you ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing I'm trying to do is to use ext3, but for that I'm going to
</I>&gt;<i> have to use another kernel. (if the above option works, I'm not going to
</I>&gt;<i> follow this one, of course).
</I>
I'm actually going to do the same -- try and build a 2.4.18 kernel with 
ext3 and 'emlog' support.  I am going to start that today, trying to 
figure out how to get it to integrate into peeweelinux build system 
(anyone have any pointers?)

&gt;<i> Hope you keep in touch, as I haven't found a lot of people interested in
</I>&gt;<i> embedded java...
</I>
We're workin on it!  Right now we're trying different JDKs (sorta), 
there's this nifty micro-java called 'Wonka' that's being tested by the 
coding crew.  But, if I can get that libnsl working, maybe we can go 
back to IBM JDK 1.3 instead....
