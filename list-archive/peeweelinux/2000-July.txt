Hi,

Yup, heard of busybox (and tinylogin). Both used to part of PeeWeeLinux
prior to the rpm compile business. I missed them in the conversion to
source rpms.

Now that you jogged my memory about them I will be adding them to
PeeWeeLinux shortly :) They're great for building floppy based systems, I
agree!

Please let me know how you make out with PeeWeeLinux! It would be nice to
see and know of users of it.

TTYL,
Adi

Hi,

Which version of pwl are you using? PeeWeeLinux is currently at version 
0.46. Unfortunately, because of problems with a router at my server site,
I haven't been able to upload a new version of PeeWeeLinux to sourceforge
or metalab. The latest version does not yet have busybox or tinylogin
included.

You're correct, the syntax between the busybox mount command and the
generic Linux mount command differ. Some of the command line switches are
not supported. This is noticeable when booting using the default supplied
rc.sysinit script and on shutdown or reboot.

I will be creating packages for busybox and tinylogin soon. Those
packages will include modified system scripts that work properly.

Another aspect of rc.sysinit is that it runs ldconfig. On a system that
has to be small it is advisable to not include ldconfig since it simply
wastes space. ldconfig can be run with a chroot like switch that processes
the libs and generates an ld.so.cache in the temporary mount location of
your build system....

TTYL,
Adi
