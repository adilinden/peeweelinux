<PRE>Hi,

Yup, heard of busybox (and tinylogin). Both used to part of PeeWeeLinux
prior to the rpm compile business. I missed them in the conversion to
source rpms.

Now that you jogged my memory about them I will be adding them to
PeeWeeLinux shortly :) They're great for building floppy based systems, I
agree!

Please let me know how you make out with PeeWeeLinux! It would be nice to
see and know of users of it.

TTYL,
Adi

</I>&gt;<i> BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single

</I>&gt;<i> utilities
</I>&gt;<i> you usually find in fileutils, shellutils, findutils, textutils, grep, gzip,
</I>&gt;<i> tar, etc.  BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any
</I>&gt;<i> small
</I>&gt;<i> or embedded system.  The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options
</I>&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;<i> their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
</I>&gt;<i> provide
</I>&gt;<i> the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in
</I>&gt;<i> mind.
</I>&gt;<i> It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude commands
</I>&gt;<i> (or
</I>&gt;<i> features) at compile time.  This makes it easy to customize your embedded
</I>&gt;<i> systems.  To create a working system, just add a kernel, a shell (such as
</I>&gt;<i> ash),
</I>&gt;<i> and an editor (such as elvis-tiny or ae).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apparently busy box is in use on such systems as Tomsrootboot disK, Storm
</I>&gt;<i> Linux Install Disks, Debian rescue disk, and the Linux Router Project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this would also be a great addition to the peewelinux package
</I>&gt;<i> and would help decrease size requirements even more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope you find this info useful and could see your way to including it in
</I>&gt;<i> your next release.
