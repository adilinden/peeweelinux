Peewee configures everything based on your target, so in this case you end up with a
bootable floppy.  Simply copying everything from the floppy to your hard drive will not
result in a bootable hard drive.

As an example, I use Peewee to configure a bootable 8MB DiskOnChip.  The DOC is installed
in my development PC while running Peewee; the part is then removed and placed in the
embedded target when Peewee is done.

In your case, installing the hard drive as a primary slave is probably the way to go.
Your target device would then be &quot;/dev/hdb&quot;, assuming you have IDE drives.  Since you are
no longer limited by the size of a floppy, this will also give you much more space to add
additional packages as needed.

Mark
