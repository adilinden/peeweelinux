<PRE>Hi everyone,
Can any one supply any example image with running X on peewee, its been long
time and many hours I am trying to get X with peewee. At last I got X
working but I have to block the mouse for that so it is of no use.

1) I installed peewee with X libs and Xserver
2) I use redhat 7.1 now , I was using Mandrake 8 before
3)I copy some file from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 like keyboard layout and server
policy
4) I copy XF86Config to /etc/X11

what I am getting if I don't bock mouse when running XF86_SVGA has
Can not open mouse(no device found)
Fatel error
than I have blocked  mouse by  AllowMouseOpenFail
and yes I am getting a graphical screen and a cursor in the centre but of no
use as I can not use mouse.
I have spend a hell of time after Xwindows on peewee, if some one can really
help me on this,
I would be appreciate if Adi you can send me some really good information
rather than just suggestions.

please explain step by step in detail that how to configure the X on peewee,
I really need that actually other wise things does not seems working easily
on Linux

Please Help

Rushi
