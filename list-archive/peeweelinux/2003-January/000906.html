<PRE>Hi , all
thanks for your overall support.

I have managed to get the X working with you ppls help, now my major task is
here and if I solve that I am done.

I am using QT/X11 for development on my mandrake 9 machine with glibc 2.2.5
and 2.4.19 kernel. My QT application is working fine with all my dynamic
libraries.

I just want this application to run on my peewee, with or without Window
manager ( I know I will be needing some window manager if I want to use my
same application source which is QT issue).


I tried to copy all the linked libraries of my application to peewee. and
its not supported and giving errors when booting.

most of them says lib.so. version GLIBC_.2.2 not found and bla bla
............:(

Now I have decided to update the version of glibc libraries by installing
2.2.5 glibc rpms on my peewee. As peewee is with glibc 2.1.3.

What do u ppl suggest.

1)I don't think , If I change the glibc 2.1.3 RPM with 2.2.5 rpm in the
Embedded Linux /rpm folder than  peewee will accept and install 2.2.5
2)if not than I can do rpm -xvf  glibc 2.2.5 ............... or do i need to
update it step by step with other older versions of glibc
3)and the last solution can be, if I install older Linux , older  QT like
1.4 or some thing and change some codes in my application as it is of QT
3.X( that's too much work :) )

4) unfortunately I am not able to compile QT statically even if I can I
don't think it will work with older glibc



need your suggestions and help.

Also Adi I would be pleased if I can help you any how to improve peewee
(else than financially ;) )

thanks for your help , waiting for you suggestions


Rushi
