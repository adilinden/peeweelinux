Subject: [Peeweelinux] loading sound modules
Message-ID: <3EE6ADBB.8020400@iinet.net.au>

Hi There

I have a soundblaster card with an ess1869 driver. I can configure it 
using sndconfig and it works but upon reboot the drivers can not be 
loaded up and I need to run sndconfig again to get the sound card to work.

By typing "modprobe sound" I get
/lib/modules/2.2.17/misc/sb.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
/lib/modules/2.2.17/misc/sb.o: insmod /lib/modules/2.2.17/misc/sb.o failed
/lib/modules/2.2.17/misc/sb.o: insmod sound failed

If I type "lsmod" before I run sndconfig I get this
Module        Size        Used        by
nls_cp437    3872        1             (autoclean)
msdos          5468        1             (autoclean)   
fat                30688      1             (autoclean) [msdos]

"tail /var/log/messages"
kernel: Soundblaster audio driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 
1993-1996
kernel: sb: dsp reset failed

The file that should be loading up the sound drivers is
****************************************
/etc/conf.modules
alias sound sb
pre-install sound /sbin/insmod sound dmabuf=1
alias midi opl3
options opl3 io=0x388
options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 mpu_io=0x330
*****************************************

I then try and run sndconfig and during it tells me
1. PnP sound card was found Model ESS ES1869 Plug and Play AudioDrive
2./etc/isapnp.conf exists and creates a backup then creates a new one
3./etc/conf.modules esists and creates a backup then creates a new one.
4.It then plays a file which I hear.
5.It then plays a midi file which I hear.

I then re-type "lsmod" and now these modules are loaded and now the 
soundcard is working perfectly

I now view the following proc files and find these lines are now added

********************************************************

I can then rmmod all the sound modules so that it is the same as before 
sndconfig and I am then able to insmod soundcore sound soundlow uart401 
and sb.o and everything works again I no longer get the "init_module: 
Device or resource busy" error when I try and "insmod sb"

However when I reboot I can load these modules - soundcore, sound, 
soundlow, uart401, opl3.
But when I type this - insmod sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 mpu_io=0x330 - I 
get this error message
Using /lib/modules/2.2.17/misc/sb.o
/lib/modules/2.2.17/misc/sb.o: init_module: Device or resource busy.

QUESTION: How do I free up dsp or init_module so that I can load my sb.o 
module?

I am really stuck here and I only have 1 week before my project is due 
so any help is so valuable to me at this time. If it means anything I 
will put you as part of my Acknowledgements in my thesis.

Kind regards Correy

Not sure if this will help or not, but check if you are using the 
busybox version of modprobe/insmod/etc or if you're using the real 
binary. I could never get busybox to work right, but including the real 
insmod solved all my problems.

(see my kernel-2.4 howto buried in the old list archives)

Its easy. Basically you can have peewee copy the custom 2.4.xx kernel over the stock 2.2 kernel. I use it all the time. 

Build a custom kernel on your development machine, copy over bzImage to your_project_directory/custom/boot/bzImage (or bzImage-full depending on what you picked for kernel package for the 2.2 kernel in the pewee setup.)

If you build all of your drivers into your kernel (recommended) you are done. Otherwise you'll have to mess around with including your modules in custom/lib  and all of that stuff.

This link helped me out a lot:

http://mail.adis.on.ca/pipermail/peeweelinux/2002-June/000608.html

Thanks to Troy Engel who wrote this.  I make my 2.4.18 kernel on 
PeeWeeLinux last week for my first time, and it works without a problem.

I am trying to get a 32 meg flash drive loaded with Linux I need it for
clustering I have failed miserably with updating to the 2.4.18 kernel I
read the how-to that was posted. It did not come close to working. I was
hoping someone would have some sort of hints on what I could do or if
there is a version of mpi that would work with the 2.2 kernel. 
 
What I did was build my kernel 2.4.18 kernel to load into ram disk and
manually unpacked the rpm's from the redhat distro that I needed and put
them in the appropriate places and then I took my newly created file
system and put it in project/$ver/mnt/ and then pushed the image with
./pwlconfig 
I always get unable to mount root fs

Emmanuel,

I'm running PeeWeeLinux 0.61.1 on my system, and if I load up pwlconfig, 
and go to Configure Project File Syste->Network Servers, there is an 
option for the thttpd server.  thttpd I think stands for Tiny HTTP 
daemon.  That is probably the easiest way to install an HTTP server.

Another man that works for us here had successfully put a scaled down 
version of apache on an embedded linux system.  He also compiled in php 
support, so that we can provide dynamic content from our tiny linux 
machine.  If you're interested in that file, let me know and I'll see 
what I can do about getting it to you.

With the ftp server, this is what I'd do: download an rpm for an ftp 
server you want to install (such as vsftpd), and unpack it using this 
command:

shell $ rpm -i --root /temporary/directory/to/install --nodeps 
--noscripts --force --nodeps --notriggers --dbpath= ./rpm.db 
--ignorearch --ignoreos myftppackage-i386.rpm

That will put all the files associated to the FTP server into the 
/temporary/directory/to/install .  Then, cd to that directory, and type:

shell $ tar cvf ../ftpserver.tar * >../ftpserver.list

That will create the tar file of the directory structure for the ftp 
server, and create the file list.  Note, the name of the .tar and the 
.list file have to be the same, except one be named with the extension 
.tar and the other .list.

I would then make a directory in my PeeWeeLinux packages directory.  On 
my system, I have my peeweelinux installed on the /root/Embedded_Build 
subdirectory.  In that directory, I have a subdirectory called 
packages.  cd to that directory, and make a directory called 
FTP_Server.  Then, copy the ftpserver.tar and ftpserver.list files to 
that directory.

Now, load up pwlconfig, and go to Configure Project File System, and 
select the FTP_Server packages.  You should then be able to select the 
FTP server you created.

Best of luck to you!

-Daniel Purcell

Message-ID: <3EF39DE0.7080300@fluid.com>

Just found a small bug in extracting the target filesystem; if you go 
into Network_Base -> netkit-base, and deselect /etc/rcS.d/50inetd, it 
will still get extracted and propogated. You have to also deselect the 
entry /etc/rcS.d/ right above 50inetd in order for it to completely go away.

I checked my <projectdir>/netkit-base.list and 50inetd wasn't there, so 
it's probably just a logic flaw somewhere.

Without knowing more I would say that the kernel *is* working, if it
signs on, finds your hardware, and makes it all the way to mounting
the root fs (file system).  Maybe it is the file system that is
causing the problem, but my educated guess is that the system
is trying to mount the wrong thing--come to think of it, it
tells you, just give us the numbers, (03:01, or whatever.)

And that would be a loader (LILO) issue.

I know how to fiddle with these issues by hand, but I don't
know very much about getting pwlconfig to do anything other
than what it is set up to do.  But there are Target Device
settings in the Target Hardware menu that may help you.

And if I'm wrong about all that, make sure you compiled 
the necessary device driver and file system into the
kernel.

I am needing to have my embedded system based on peewee linux to autologin
and start my application. I noticed that there is reference to the bootx.tgz
file but I don't know where to download it. Could someone please let me know
where I can get this file from.

Thanks,

Joe

Joe,

You can launch your application from the rc.init file. I use the following
rc.init.
MyApplication simply starts my application

Jan

---------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# /rc.init
#
# Starts the system. It only contains boot specific things like
# mounting filesystems. Upon termination it executes /etc/rc.sysinit
# to do all the traditional sysinit stuff.
#

# Set the path
PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
export PATH

# Mount /etc
mount -n /dev
mount -n /etc

# Now that we have a read-write mtab
>/etc/mtab

# Enter root and etc into mtab
mount -f /
mount -f /dev
mount -f /etc

# Let the 'real' rc.sysinit take over
/etc/rc.sysinit

# Configure network
ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.160 up
ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 broadcast 127.255.255.255

# Mount writeable partition
mount /dev/hda3 /mnt/flash3
cd /mnt/flash3/bin

# Launch application
./MyApplication

If you want your system to autologin you could edit /etc/inittab and replace
the line looking like
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty ttyl
with
1:2345:respawn:/usr/bin/openvt -f -c l -w -- /bin/login -f root
or with
1:2345:respawn:/usr/bin/openvt -f -c l -w -- su -l root

I use this with my embedded system and it works.
Bye

Massimo

Hiyas,
   I was wondering, has anyone rebuilt peewee for a
2.4 build?  Something that would use the latest
versions of software apps, a nice 2.4 kernel and the
like and not require any backward compatability
packages?
