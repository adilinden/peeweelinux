I assume you meant _not_ use the busybox shell!! That is what I am
currently doing.

&gt;<i> I am trying to tune busybox and tinylogin for PeeWeeLinux sometime soon. I

</I>
Part of the problem with that is some of the initscripts are generated
by the pwl scripts. Most of my recent changes the system I am working on
has been accomplished by hacking the pwl scripts. Most of the changes
are not very elegant, but they get the job done. When I get some time,
I'd be happy to share what I've done and why. That isn't likely to
happen before the holidays though.

I am using busybox for most everything except mount and (la)sh.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Absolutely. In addition it would be an idea to build a system using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; busybox and tinylogin. Both are included with PeeWeeLinux but I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; had any hands on configuring a system with busybox and tinylogin using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; PeeWeeLinux in a long time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The mount command in busybox does not work properly with the current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; startup scripts. In particular, the -n option on mount is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented in busybox which causes the rc.init script to fail. You need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use the standalone mount to make things work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There also seems to be an issue with lash beyond it's inability to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handle if-then-else statements in scripts, but I haven't had the time to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; figure that out yet.
