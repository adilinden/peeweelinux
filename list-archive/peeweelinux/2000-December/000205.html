<PRE>Just try it ?
I have installed the CD just supplied (binaries) and tried to make a
&quot;minimal&quot; configuration using pwlconfig.


My system consists of a 686 PC with peewee installed on
/hdb/root/Embedded_Build

with hda as a 32 MB Dos formatted SanDisk. 
Althugh I have a fd0 I do not want to use it as a transfer media


firstly I cannot get &quot;/root/custom&quot;  to get and alter packages it says guess
again.
The only custom directory seems to be in
/root/Embedded_Build/projects/minimal/custom


Then I tried to load to target and faithfully changed the references to
/dev/sda and /dev/fd0 to /dev/hda
and selected DOS12 and pressed the majic button. 
After confirming that I did want to proceed it told me that I was
unsucesfull ????  &quot;YES&quot; to see why but a blank results screen, nothing...

I looked on my SanDisk /dev/hda and it too had no contents.  

So to test the SanDisk accessI tried to cp /bin/* to /dev/hda and it worked
so I could access the hda



What am I doing wrong
