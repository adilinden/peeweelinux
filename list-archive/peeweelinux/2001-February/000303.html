<PRE>I have some problems to run my peewee linux box at the network. My goal
is to establish a simple telnet session to the linux box inside a
intranet (192.168.0.xxx).

I´m working with peewee 0.53.27.

My peewee linux box has one network interface eth0 and my peewee system
is based onto the example project &quot;wireless isa&quot; and it´s network
scripts.

I have connected a laptop at the linux box. The ping command will work
fine from the laptop to the linux box and vice versa.

A Telnet session locally at the linux box will work properly, but an
attempt to start a telnet session from the laptop to the linuxbox will
fail. With tcpdump i can see the telnet request, but an answer from the
linux-box is missing.

A telnet session from the linux box to the laptop will fail, too. With
tcpdump I can see the request from the linux-box and the response from
the laptop but nothing more will happen.

It seems that all incoming ip-packets were lost at the linux box and
don´t reach the application (INETD or TELNET).

In my tests i´m working always with ip-addresses not with hostnames. I
build different systems with all peewee kernels and my own custom
kernel, but the result is always the same.

It seems to be a configuration problem.

Maybe I have to configure IP-masquerading or routing in a certain
manner?

Any idea why this isnt working?

Thank you for helping and reading my problem

Peter
