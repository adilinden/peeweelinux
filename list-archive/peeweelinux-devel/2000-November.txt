Hi,

I introduced some bugs into 0.53.8 which have been fixed with the 0.53.10
release. To update any older 0.53 archive just download either one:

http://peeweelinux.org/pub/Projects/Embedded/peeweelinux-0.53.10-cfg.tar.gz
http://download.sourceforge.net/embedded/peeweelinux-0.53.10-cfg.tar.gz

TTYL,
Adi

Hi,

I just uploaded the latest work on PeeWeeLinux. Find it at
http://peeweelinux.org/pub/Projects/Embedded/peeweelinux-0.53.14-cfg.tar.gz

Some of the changes:
- Improved the speed when entering 'Configure Target Hardware'.
- Added 'Append Option' to bootloader. Enter 'debug=0' for silent boot.
- Added version checking on config file. From now on, when an older
  project is used in a newer PeeWeeLinux release, the config file will
  be updated to the newest setting. All old settings are retained and
  new parameters and options are set to their default values.

I've tested this with the minimal package but not exhaustively.

TTYL,
Adi

Subject: Silent booting in 0.53.15
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10011140054010.8441-100000@big.adis.on.ca>

Hi,

Here is 0.53.15, to be found at

    http://peeweelinux.org/pub/Projects/Embedded

The most noticable changes are a fix to the boot script for a read-only
filesystem when an older project is used.

The boot scripts were modified to be silent if the file "/etc/boot.silent"
exists. At this point this file is not created when "debug=0" is given as
an append option. But it should work fine if it is added as a custome file
like "touch <custom location>/etc/boot.silent". Note that this requires:

    1. A complete PeeWeelinux download (bin or src or iso) - or -
       replacing the old initscripts-1.4-1.i386.rpm with
       initscripts-1.5-1.i386.rpm (can be found at
       http://peeweelinux.org/pub/Projects/Embedded/Embedded_Build/RPMS
    2. Any custom rc.sysinit and/or rcS scripts to be replaced
       with the new scripts.
    3. Don't forget to add "debug=0" and to create "/etc/boot.silent" for
       quiet booting.

An important note: I did not get a chance to test the uploaded release!!!
I tested the changes but there is always a chance of typos when I made the
changes in the real release rather then my test environment!

Also, I will be travelling for the next week. I will check email and
answer questions as I can, but I won't have access to a PeeWeeLinux system
to anything 'hands-on'...

Hi,

Released 0.53.16 this morning. Just a minor but important fix I forgot
last night. Now mounted volumes like /mnt/cdrom shouldn't interfere with
pwlconfigs checks prior to mounting the target drive.

This change only affects the peeweelinux-0.53.16-cfg.tar.gz file, the
packages remain unchanged from 0.53.15.

TTYL,
Adi
