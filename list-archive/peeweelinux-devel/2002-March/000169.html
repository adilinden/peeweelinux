<PRE>Hi Mark,

I am documenting all the steps I take to create the development 
environment. This means it will be possible to actually PeeWeeLinux from 
scratch using a bunch of scripts. This would include downloading the 
sources from the original sites (I.e. gcc from gnu.org).

I am thinking about a directory structure similar to what's below. This 
might seem awkward at first, but it will allow for chroot to /peeweelinux 
and building of packages within the chrooted environment. Now it won't 
mater any longer what underling Linux distribution is used for 
PeeWeeLinux.

When RPMS are build, a &lt;packagename&gt;-devel rpm would be build for the sole 
purpose of installing in the chrooted environment. This will make it easy 
to link against just the libs that are part of PeeWeeLinux.

Any thoughts on this?

&gt;<i> I kind of like the way the Linux Router Project guys do things like this.  They have
</I>&gt;<i> something called a &quot;LRP&quot; package, and it's fairly easy for a novice user to grab
</I>&gt;<i> additional LRP packages, and integrate them into their project.  For the power users,
</I>&gt;<i> there's good documentation on how to build LRP packages from scratch, and contribute them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like they have &quot;core&quot; distributions, containing the basic required packages, and
</I>&gt;<i> then the user can expand on the basic system by using as many LRP packages as space
</I>&gt;<i> permits.  Each of these additional LRP packages aren't necessarily part of the core
</I>&gt;<i> distribution; users simply download individual packages as needed.  I don't know if these
</I>&gt;<i> LRP concepts are relevant to Peewee, but I thought I'd pass it along.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless of the implementation, coming up with an easy way for people to contribute
</I>&gt;<i> additional packages is a great idea!  You've really got a great thing going here, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> among the many people who want to help make it better.  Whatever you come up with, I'd be
</I>&gt;<i> glad to help develop, test, and document it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We probably should take this discussion to the list.  I've already seen a number of really
</I>&gt;<i> good suggestions and ideas out there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.  I've (temporarily) posted my DiskOnChip/Peewee instructions to my website.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> been corresponding with a board vendor (<A HREF="http://www.c2central.com/page514613.htm">http://www.c2central.com/page514613.htm</A>) that is
</I>&gt;<i> interesting in using Peewee.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I used their UIB product for one of my clients, and I have another project where I might
</I>&gt;<i> end up using it again.  Their 8MB DoC comes with preinstalled Redhat 6.2, but was more
</I>&gt;<i> aimed at a specific application, rather than a &quot;generic&quot; Linux distribution.  I used
</I>&gt;<i> Peewee to start over from scratch -- worked great!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
