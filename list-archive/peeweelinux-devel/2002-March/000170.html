Being able to rebuild Peewee from scratch would be great.  I assume that this would allow
the user to easily rebuild with any version of gcc, glibc, etc.  Would this scheme greatly
increase the size of the Peewee distribution -- and would the &quot;binary&quot; only version still
be available?

</I>
What would be the process of adding new packages to the pwlconfig menus?  Is this
something that could be automated, or would any new packages added end up as &quot;custom&quot;
files?

Also, the ability for people to easily contribute Peewee packages would be nice.  I
envision the Peewee website having an area for user contributed packages, and other users
could simply download a given package (binary only, or complete source), and add it to
their already installed base.  Again, this is similar to LRP packages; for an example, see
