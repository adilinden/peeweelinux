&gt;<i> Hi Ralph,

</I>oops, left those out too:-)
...one thing I was thinking would be helpful..search the *.list files
in the packages directory to find a specific file.  If that file is found,
then I can prompt the user to include the package/file in their configuration.

(OR include the package/file in the new &quot;package-dep.tar&quot; ?? it would be 
duplicated, but it doesn't affect the extract process..)

Now, if it is a completely new file, not part of any pwl packages, I can
do a locate on their hard drive and copy it. OR is there an RPM that 
contains the library files ? Hmmmmm...

Again, so far I'm only concerning myself with binaries....

&gt;<i> But all PeeWeeLinux packages should be build from source tar balls or
</I>&gt;<i> source rpms, I think. None of the copying from a running system or a
</I>&gt;<i> binary rpm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>that would be optimial...but my current process
pwl_rpmloader
package
is a quick way to build a package to run and test.  Optimize them after
they are working...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the key to that happening is to have a well defined and documented
</I>&gt;<i> process of how to create a PeeWeeLinux package.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The best documentation is if we can script it &quot;generically&quot;.  In order
to script a &quot;rebuild&quot; of packages xyz, all I need is a patch file, maybe
a short xyz script that I can run...

Then to build a package, the package maker must:
1. create a patch file
2. create a make_pkg file that handles all the uniqueness for the package.

I'd have to see a patch and make_pkg to integrate it, since I've never 
actually compiled anything :-)

&gt;<i> So as far as creating packages is concerned this has become a rather
</I>&gt;<i> urgent thing to be decided on. Since the build process for packages should
</I>&gt;<i> be reproduceable. So here is what needs to be done:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Raw Sources           ---&gt;  PeeWeeLinux Sources
</I>&gt;<i> PeeWeeLinux Sources   ---&gt;  PeeWeeLinux Binaries
</I>&gt;<i> PeeWeeLinux Binaries  ---&gt;  PeeWeeLinux Packages
</I>Nearly done on the last step!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. What do we use for Raw sources?
</I>&gt;<i>   a. Source tarballs
</I>&gt;<i>      We can extract the tarballs from Redhat source rpms where
</I>&gt;<i>      source rpms exist.
</I>&gt;<i>   b. Redhat RPMS
</I>&gt;<i>      Where source rpms don't exist we have to create either
</I>&gt;<i>      Redhat RPMS or Source RPMS first
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes.

&gt;<i> 2. Do we create and keep PeeWeeLinux sources (already patched
</I>&gt;<i>    and ready to compile?). Or do we keep the original sources
</I>&gt;<i>    and apply PeeWeeLinux patches?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I think I'd go for the PeeWeeLinux patches.  That way, when the
original is upgraded, the patch *Might* work on the upgarde, otherwise,
just modify the patch a little...

&gt;<i> 3. Do we create PeeWeeLinux tar packages or PeeWeeLinux rpms
</I>&gt;<i>    (both binaries)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I still like the tar files, unless you can figure out how to make 
the rpms re-locatable. (or use /tmp/pwl_tmp for all rpms or something).

&gt;<i> &gt; The key here is that this *painful process* need only be done once...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's correct. But what we use to start with and what it results in
</I>&gt;<i> should be well defined. I looked at the Linux Router Project and I thought
</I>&gt;<i> making LPR packages is a mess. I don't want the same for PeeWeeLinux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>yep, I never got into lrp because of it's configuration stuff...too much
to read!
 
&gt;<i> The easier the process is to follow the more likely people will contribute
</I>&gt;<i> a complete set of sources/patches/binaries for PeeWeeLinux...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it time to start to ask for help / Announce Pee Wee to a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bunch of news groups /mailing lists ?? (Pee Wee Comes out of the closet!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's still far from a plug-and-play solution. I think I'd rather stick to
</I>&gt;<i> announcing updates on freshmeat for now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Oh...I haven't been checking freshmeat myself ...

&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe after I integrate the package stuff and the ram disk stuff...and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we get a few projects working...of course, we can always come up with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more features...We need a marketing guy to say STOP, SHIP it NOW!:-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Software programs are never finished...only abandoned&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it'll be never finished. But the framework needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> established.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
we're getting close...just need to close the loop on this package thing...
handle a few more devices...hmmmm...well, we are closer than we were last week!

Later,
Ralph
