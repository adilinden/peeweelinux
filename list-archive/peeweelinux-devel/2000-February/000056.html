<PRE>Gary,
Thanks for trying PWL ! I hope its a help for your project.
Some answers your questions below:

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: PeeWeeLinux - pwlconfig behavior
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Adi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First let me say that PeeWee Linux is pretty useful for me.  I have tried
</I>&gt;<i> other mini-distributions like the Linux Router Project but the integrated
</I>&gt;<i> project/package management via pwlconfig is very convenient.  I am mailing
</I>&gt;<i> you since I see some odd behavior in pwlconfig itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem I find is mainly when I don't want a specific file from a certain
</I>&gt;<i> package.  For instance, I don't want that huge /etc/termcap from the 
</I>&gt;<i> base_filesystem package.  If I disable that file, exit from pwlconfig, and
</I>&gt;<i> enter again, the /etc/termcap will be enabled again?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'm guessing here that you need to save your project before you exit.

When you start configuring a package, a temporary &quot;.package.list&quot; file is
created from either 1) the projects last &quot;package.list&quot; file or 2) from
the &quot;Embedded_Build/../package.list&quot; file.

As you make changes, the &quot;.package.list&quot; file is modified.  This file
remains until you save the project.  If you exit without saving, a
(verbose but highly clear :-?) message asks if you want to continue with
the changes you made previously, or revert to your last saved project.

If you revert, your changes will be lost and &quot;build_files_verify&quot; will
create an new &quot;.package.file&quot; when you start to re-configure that package
again.

If you continue, your &quot;.package.file&quot; remains and is updated until you 
save your project.

Anyhow, thats the way its supposed to work.  Programmers are the worst 
testers, so I *Know* there is some testing to do here :-)

If this is not the case for the problem you are seeing, please let me 
know 1) what version of pwlconfig you are using and 2) any short list 
of inputs that cause the problem to occur.  

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I have written up a short script to pack up the project mount point and
</I>&gt;<i> generate a root disk image suitable for making a root floppy.  If I clean it
</I>&gt;<i> up a bit, would you like me to send you a copy?  I noticed that the &quot;put
</I>&gt;<i> PWL on a floppy&quot; documentation is missing at the moment and not supported
</I>&gt;<i> in pwlconfig.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes!! that would be great. I'm currently concentrating on getting the script
features in that I want (I don't even have a marketing dept. to blame for
scope creep here!) and trying to get our companys' thin client out the door...
Thus, the Floppy and CD rom are sorely neglected...Any other features you
think might be handy, just let us know!

BTW, I guess I'll have to post my latest upgrade, V0.85.  I have a new script,

pwl_template

that will build a file that has the framework for PWL scripts.  The result
is a program that parses the command line and has a working dialog box
built in....just add the good stuff in the middle :-)

&gt;<i> thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>   Gary
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Thank you too for helping to test this...if enough people help here, maybe
the number of HOW-TO's everyone needs to read will continue to shrink!

Later, 
Ralph Stickley
