&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's what I am doing. I'd like PeeWeeLinux to become a platform that can
</I>&gt;<i> be build entirely from sources. My goal would be a distibution where you
</I>&gt;<i> can run a single script to build all packages from sources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
?? 
If the optimized list of files for an RPM are manually generated, the package
files created by pwl_rpmloader *should* be close in size to the manually
compiled files (+ 10% maybe).

The problem is removing dependencies (link ncurses, pam) - these have to
be &quot;compiled out&quot;.
??
Is that a reasonable summary ?? Hmmmm...

If we have to use the source tars (w/o RH patches) to get rid of
the pam secuirity and whatever else, thats no problem for me. However,
actually compiling the programs I'd rather not do if I don't have to...
but then, I'm not counting bytes here, only Mega bytes....A truely
memory restrained embedded system might be more concerned with size.

&gt;<i> Still the question is if PeeWeeLinux should be based on Redhat source RPMS
</I>&gt;<i> or generic tar balls and patches of packes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Until then I am building packages more for my own consumption. 
</I>
Yep, and as more and more people build packages (Hey, my package is 
smaller than YOUR package!) the package sources will continue to grow
in number and shrink in size :-)

&gt;<i> Makes them pretty big! Your X is 16M? 
</I>
Ummm...well, its only 10M now that I don't have 3 copies of all the lib 
files (somewhere along the line, I didn't do a cp -ax, and the links weren't
copied, the files were duplicated)...my X11 package file is getting smaller!

&gt;<i> Yup, it's a painstaking manual
</I>&gt;<i> process. Scripting would be a bit of a pain since you would need a custom
</I>&gt;<i> script for each package. It makes reproducing the package easier. But
</I>&gt;<i> then, that why I did PWL in the very beginning, so I didn't have to do the
</I>&gt;<i> manual prosess of selecting and stripping executables and checking for
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies every single time I build a project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The key here is that this *painful process* need only be done once...
Is it time to start to ask for help / Announce Pee Wee to a 
bunch of news groups /mailing lists ?? (Pee Wee Comes out of the closet!)

Maybe after I integrate the package stuff and the ram disk stuff...and
we get a few projects working...of course, we can always come up with 
more features...We need a marketing guy to say STOP, SHIP it NOW!:-)

&quot;Software programs are never finished...only abandoned&quot;


&gt;<i> PeeWeeLinux has met it's original goal of why I build it. I still think
</I>&gt;<i> that it's worthwhile to develop it further by automating the build from
</I>&gt;<i> sources once the original build has been done. That would also make it
</I>&gt;<i> possible to establish guidelines for contributed packages and what's
</I>&gt;<i> expected from them....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Hmmm... a true &quot;raw&quot; distribution...sounds tough, but if we have patch
files, ftp sites...doesn't sound too hard (just send me your patches!).

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; To Do: load the source rpm, install it, copy the source files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; and compile everything.  Then copy the binaries from the SRC 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; directory into the pkg.files directory.....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Yup, that would be the best way of doing it. Or... download the original
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sources and compile from scratch. Then make a build script and a patch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; file... Otherwise it might get messy if we build some packages from rpm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and others from tar...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey, if you have a link to each of the source files...we can ftp them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; over instead of using the RH CD...not bad...I guess RH does some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes from the originals, not sure of other advantages of ftp vs RH
</I>&gt;<i> RPM...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The changes Redhat did to the Redhat RPMS are in the form of patches.
</I>&gt;<i> Sooo, it's easy to build whatever you like from the source rpm because the
</I>&gt;<i> original tar ball is still there (plus a number patches, some redhat some
</I>&gt;<i> not).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess one way to build packages would be to take the source rpm and
</I>&gt;<i> extract the original tarball and non-redhat specific patches... Then keep
</I>&gt;<i> these as the PWL sources and build our packages from the tar files...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or use rpm and build redhat rpms for every package that's not part of
</I>&gt;<i> RedHat (elvis-tiny, busybox, tinylogin, to name a few that instantly come
</I>&gt;<i> to mind)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Not bad...then we don't have to stop at RH, but all the rpm stuff still
works..

&gt;<i> The nice thin about Redhat rpms is they compile as is. With orignal tar
</I>&gt;<i> balls quite often they have to be 'fixed' before they will compile....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Geeze, thats handy!

&gt;<i> &gt; Anyhow, I guess this is the &quot;idiots tool for package building&quot; (just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my speed :-) your packages are still the best! But, Hey, if you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have 128MB flash disk...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Almost fit a Gnome workstation on that sucker... Just have to rmember not
</I>&gt;<i> to use swap space on flash then :) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'd be happy to get fvwm2 working!!!

&gt;<i> BTW, someone asked me that question... seriously! If 32MB of RAM isn't
</I>&gt;<i> enough, couldn't we use a 64MB flash drive and make a 32MB swap partition?
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting thought, eh...?  Ouch... :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Maybe they could add a hard disk for the swap space ?;-)

Later,
Ralph
