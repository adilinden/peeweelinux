Hi,

PeeWeeLinux v0.20 is now available. The biggest changes from 0.19 are the
patch files to turn sources into PWL packages. As a result the source
distribution is now less than half the size.

Added thttpd a single threaded webserver with htaccess style
authentication and cgi capabilities.

Added dhcpcd a dhcp client dor situations where pump fails to work
properly.

TTYL,
Adi

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10003051201590.10927-100000@big.adis.on.ca>

Hi Ralph,

Just making notes of some random PeeWeeLinux ideas. Thought I'd email them
to you to see what you think...

I cc'd this to the PeeWeeLinux lists. Perhaps someone else using PWL has
ideas or suggestions, too?

Package Names
-------------

Currently packages are named like thttpd-1.2.3.tar indicating the name and
version of the software. This naming applies to all packages build from
original sources regardless of whether they came from the original author
or were taken from a SRPM.

Currently packages build from precompiled binaries (RedHat rpm or running
system) are named thttpd-1.2.3-rh.tar to indicate the fact they were not
compiled and taken from the system. Perhaps still stripped and dependency
checked and associated scripts changed, but no other changes.

Would it make sense to start adding a version numer similar to what RedHat
does? Like creating thttpd-1.2.3-1.tar for the initial release. When a
package is changed due to bugfixes, etc, the version number of the package
could be incremented like thttpd-1.2.3-2.tar. Obviously this wouldn't
happen with every PeeWeeLinux release but as bugs are reported and fixed
or as other features are added.

File List
---------

If you look at the Embedded_Build directory, there is a file called
Filelist (I think) which contains the package names and files associated
with it. Would it make sense to keep a file like it, indicating the
included package name and the related files?

As one of the todo tasks I want to eliminate duplicate files in packages.
Since networking is an obvious feature of Linux I will change the
arrangements of packages in a way that it assumed that networking is going
to be installed. I want to remove all the configuration files from the
base_filesystem and base_libs packages and create a base_script or
base_configuration package that contains all those. Things to include
there would be:

/etc/services
/etc/protocols
/etc/nsswitch

Subsequently I am removing those files from their duplicate places...

Should the Filelist file include the descriptions entered in the
package.README files? I tend to not to include them to not clutter up the
filelist file.

Maintaining the filelist file would make it easy to chack for duplicate
files within the PWL distribution and to enable on to quickly find a
particular binary, i.e. which package includes 'su'?

Distributing PWL
----------------

I am thinking about creating a PWL packages directory on the server in
which to keep all the packages for individual download. Perhaps gzip the
packages, though. This would allow for individual packages to be
downloaded rather than the complete archive if some packages are added.
Also, it would allow for newly build packages to be made available
immediately without having to wait for a new release.

I am a bit torn between the idea of creating a new release too often or
not often enough. Just adding a couple of packes doesn't necessarily
justify creating a new release, especially if some known bugs haven't been
addressed. On the other hand I don't want to not release new features and
additions because I won't have time to address some issues immediately. I
need some guidance here.

Closing
-------

This all comes to mind because I will have a crude X package compiled from
sources soon. This will add some 40MB to the source distribution. I think
it's a bit of a waste to have to download a 50MB file for some minor
changes... I guess there's always the binary distribution.

TTYL,
Adi

Hi Adi, Hi Ralph.

My name is Dennis Tokarski. I run a little one-man consulting shop in
Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. Mostly my work is software development for
real time and embedded systems, much of that driver writing, and almost
all of it for QNX (at least for the past 6 years or so).

However, I am finding Linux a compelling alternative for some
applications. The learning curve has been a bit steep, and have found
Beck & Co's book "Linux Kernel Internals" very helpful. I am now
part way through Rubini's very excellent "Linux Device Drivers".

Recently a client approached me about putting together a small footprint
Linux package for use in their embedded product. The hardware isn't
really constrained (Pentium/133 at least, 64MB RAM, all the usual PC
desktop facilities like SVGA, etc), but they do have a peculiar
requirement in they aren't allowed to use a hard drive, or any kind
of alterable media for program storage.

In a previous incarnation of this project, we've booted QNX4 from ROM,
with all the ancillary applications loaded from a ROM disk. I'd like to
work my way toward a similar capability using Linux.

PeeWeeLinux seems to be the best starting point. I've spent a couple of
days looking for small-footprint distributions. There are lots out
there, but as Ralph noted in a January 26 post about YASL, some have
just sort of faded away. I didn't find anyone else using the 2.2 kernel,
it's all 2.0 as far as I could tell. Nor does anyone appear to have
their project as cleanly organized as yours, or set up to use as current
a development platform as current as RH 6.1, which is what I'm running
in my office. By the way, while I've downloaded your latest (0.20) I've
not taken it for a test drive. I expect to have that pleasure later
today or tomorrow.

The one common thread amongst all the small Linices seems to be that
they boot from floppy, or more rarely as in your case, Disk On Chip.
I've used the DOC parts before with QNX. They're OK, but in my current
project the fact that they behave like writeable disks is a problem.

Adi, I think you mentioned in a readme file somewhere something about
writing an open source file system driver. Have you done anything with
that idea yet?

If not, perhaps this is where I can make a contribution in the near
future. I was thinking of using the existing dos/fat file system as a
starting point, then seeing what I could carve out and otherwise modify
to suit my customer's requirements. The result would have to be
suitable for use with a disk image on ROM (hopefully using compression
to save space), and could probably be used with battery backed SRAM
(which we also have on our hardware).

The other thing I'm looking to do is solve the boot-from-ROM problem.
Nobody has done this so far as I can tell. My current thought is to
locate a modified version of lilo in one of our user bios ROMs. It would
have hard-wired knowledge of a ROM address where it would find an
essentially conventional Linux boot image which it would relocate to low
RAM and start up. After that it would be business as usual. This is
basically what we did with QNX, so the idea is at least workable.
Ultimately what we'd like to achieve is an execute-from-ROM ability, but
I'm most definitely not knowledgeable enough about Lines yet to tackle
that one.

So, do think these sorts of things would be useful additions to your
project? Of course, any advice and moral support you can provide while I
do the dog work will be greatly appreciated.

You've put together a nice package. I look forward to using it and
giving something back.

Hi Dennis,

I hope we have something here you can use. Like you, I think both Adi
and I want to build on the "latest" RH distribution, but finding nothing
available we ended up doing it ourselves.

We are currently trying to get the system up with X windows. Adi is
doing all the library and binary compiling and configuring (all the
in-depth technical stuff).  I am developing the pwlconfig program 
as a means 1) to stop the never ending studying of How-Tos and
2) because nobody else has done it.  I started reading all the 
How-Tos and then would have to go back and re-read them...never 
being good at following the instructions, I could never get anything
to work twice in a row :-o

I am configuring and booting from Disk-On-Chip (Msystems) Disk-On-Module
(PQI) and Compact flash cards (IDE to CF adaptor from PC-Engines).
This will also work from any partition on any mounted hard drive.
We haven't done the Floppy or CD-ROM boot image yet.

The next big ToDo is a read-only partition and/or ramdisk boot...

Note: the freeBIOS group is currently working to install LILO in
ROM and maybe even the kernel in rom.  I recommend checking with them
to figure out where they are ...

As a little background: I spent a year or so working with QNX - it 
seems a bit cleaner than the Linux stuff, probably because it all came 
from the same shop, but the costs are way too high for the project I'm 
working on now.  You can see our "thin client" at:

Is a write protected flash drive sufficient ? This would make development
a lot easier.  Maybe start here, get it working then migrate to a ROM...
Do you have the Source for your BIOS ? (BTW, General Software BIOS is 
fairly cheap if you have any development budget...FreeBIOS isn't quite
there yet)

Several commerical "Thin Clients" are being sold with write protected
M-Systems devices.  With the proper tools from the server, they can
be in-field upgraded by application, services or kernel.  Maybe a
CD-ROM boot would work if you have the hardware, but the upgrade
is more on-site than most would like for large numbers of installed
units.

I think PWL will be a nice starting point. Just using this in a different
environment and testing the stuff that is currently installed will be a big
help.  Our ultimate goal is to have available Pee Wee Linux projects" for a
router, print server, thin client and whatever...you didn't mention the end
product, but if they let you GPL everything, any projects you create would be a
welcome addition (Note, a project is simply a list of tar files (packages) and
lists of files within the tar files to include in the final file system - any
custom code or drivers could easily be excluded)

Thanks, let us know of any problems you find.  The latest code for pwlconfig is
not fully installed in the CVS tree, but the download has a reasonably updated
version. I'll try to get another version posted as soon as I "just a few more
features" working (actually Adi does the web page updating :-). 
 
Good luck,
Ralph

A subset of that work will be useful to us as well. I'm thinking we
might
use just the SVGA server, maybe even a stripped down version of it, to
do mode switching and provide low level graphics primitives. We have an
existing applications level graphics library that's compact and well
suited
to the application which we could layer on top of that.

I just can't see trying to use all of X, it's whopping huge.

That makes two of us. I'm wading through lots of docs right now to
figure
out the minimal set of components in your distro that will fit on a
single
floppy and still boot.

Yeah, that's what I found to be missing right off.

I'm running your pwlconfig 0.82. Looks like you've got some floppy
support
there, but so far you assume the target device is big enough to hold
everything
on an uncompressed file system. Support for a compressed ramdisk image
might
be useful.

In a couple more days I should have a page or two of notes for you on my
pwlconfig experience. I found one trivial bug so far, most of my items
are
just user interface issues.

Well, only partly. I've had a lot of discussions/arguments with a friend
about this lately, and I am really convinced that architecture matters.
There
is just so much messy baggage and clunkiness that comes along with a
monolithic
architecture. I think micro kernels got a bad rap because Mach was so
poorly
done, and was hardly "micro". As QNX has forced me to realize, the data
copying
that goes with synchronous message passing is generally so little as to
impose
no meaningful performance penalty. And the notion that you can use a
user-space
debugger on a driver (except for the ISR), even to the point of doing
post mortem
dump analysis, is a wonderful thing.

But you are right, QNX is expensive in an absolute sense, even if it's
not when compared to some of its competitors.

Oh sure, for development we can do anything we find convenient. Products
which go into the field can not use run-time writeable program store,
it's
a regulatory requirement. There's even a question of whether it's
permissible
to load from ROM and execute from RAM. We *may* wind up having to have
our
code segments in ROM. I hope not though.

> Do you have the Source for your BIOS ? (BTW, General Software BIOS is

No source, but we don't need it. The CPU board is a Radisys thing, and
Radisys will supply us with the BIOS as a binary image which we burn
into
the BIOS ROM along with our own user BIOS extension. The interface
between
the two is minimal and well defined.

That would be a real no-no for us.

That's it for now, time to hit the HOWTOs some more. I'll get you some
substantive feedback presently.

Hey,

I think there are some smaller graphics libraries... X is not the place to
start if your space constrained...the smallest SVGA server I've seen is about
1MB...

Check out RH /sbin/mkbootdisk for a minimal set of files...then optimize the
kernel to shrink that too. Of couse, you probably want some applications -
oops, now your floppy is full, fast.

If 1 floppy is your goal, then you can count out X entirely...note that the
older kernels 2.0.36 are supposed to be smaller also.

I hope that Adi gets the 0.90 released today...I now have the floppy thing
going but still no Ramdisk.  Hmmm...somebody else was asking about the ramdisk
thing :-)

Great! I'm probably too close to the code to test it throughly or see what
could be improved.  Check out the 0.90 changes for a few new features and bug
fixes :-)

As if your program could run without RAM - either the RAM works or it doesn't.
If it works, then execute from there, if it doesn't, shut the thing off.  If
your program is going in the weeds and overwritting RAM, then nothing is
guarenteed, wether its code or data space, it doesn't matter (try to trash 1
bit on your stack space and see what happens)...

I've seen some regulations that require "NO INTERRUPTS" because its impossible
to test every possible path (since an interrupt path can be added at
anytime)...you just have to wonder...where do these "regulation people:" come
from ?

Anyhow, you might do a search for Linux and XIP (eXecute In Place). 

Later,
Ralph

Hi,

The latest stable PeeWeeLinux release is now available. Downloading from
the adis.on.ca server is difficult these days. So I waited with this
announcement until all the files are available on sourceforge.

The sources:
    http://download.sourceforge.net/embedded/embedded-0.32-src.tar.gz

The binaries:
    http://download.sourceforge.net/embedded/embedded-0.32-bin.tar.gz
    http://download.sourceforge.net/embedded/embedded-0.32-bin.supp.tar.gz

The uncompressed source tree of the latest PeeWeeLinux release is from now
on available on the adis.on.ca server:

    http://adis.on.ca/pub/Projects/Embedded/Embedded_Build/

A list of the latest changes:
