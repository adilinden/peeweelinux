There is a broken link on the main page:

http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO.html

it should point to:

http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO/index.html

The site is very nice looking... going to brush up on the distro as well as the
config tool.

Subject: PeeWee Linux for the Power PC
Message-ID: <00081204053302.12410@down.terraplex.com>

Hi all,

I work for a Power PC Linux company as a software engineer.  I would like to
see about getting PeeWee Linux working under the ppc architecture.  Since most
embedded systems are designed for the Motorola chips I believe this is a
logical step.

So, I look forward to working with everyone and I'll be in touch. :-)

Best Regards,
Charles Stevenson
