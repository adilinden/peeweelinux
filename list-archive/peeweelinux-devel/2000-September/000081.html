&gt;<i> Thanks guys.  Installed it and it worked great.

</I>&gt;<i> I looked at a copy of Red Hat 6.1 but it is using the 2.2.12 kernel

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think we went with 2.2.14 to get USB support...
 
&gt;<i> What do I need to do to compile the sources? The documentation says 
</I>&gt;<i> that I need Red Hat installed but not much else besides that. Has 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone patched PWL with RTLinux or RTAI? 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>BTW, There is nothing keeping pwlconfig from working with any other
distribution (if its rpmd nicely ).  If you find someone to rpm RTLinux, LEM,
LRP or whatever, then you could select a base configuration from one of
those...In fact the main file configuration menu could just be a list of
distributions (yet another feature - oops).

&gt;<i>Do you need a hand with the 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation or anything? I don't have much spare time but I could 
</I>&gt;<i> expand on the docs that you have as I'm learning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Wow - that would be great. The pending changes for ramdisk support should be
incorporated before you get started...release planned real soon now :)

&gt;<i> I'm currently writing about building embedded systems with LabVIEW 
</I>&gt;<i> and Linux for Gary W. Johnson and Richard T. Jennings &quot;LabVIEW 
</I>&gt;<i> Graphical Programming, 3 rd Edition&quot; to be published early next year. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Great - I love National Instruments stuff - I've used 7 or 8 of their boards
and have written tons of code in LabWindows/CVI.  Hey, why all the LabView
books an no books on LabWindows/CVI ?? If you plan on doing a complementary
book for LabWindows let me know!

&gt;<i> I'm really excited about PeeWeeLinux because you guys made something 
</I>&gt;<i> hard into something pretty easy. You still need to be knowledgeable 
</I>&gt;<i> about how Linux works but PWL takes a _lot_ of the work out of 
</I>&gt;<i> trimming down or building up an embedded system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Thats what I thought too, I just wonder why nobody else has done this...

&gt;<i> We're going to try to show people how easy it is to build an embedded 
</I>&gt;<i> system using LabVIEW, Linux and VMware.  We plan on shipping one or 
</I>&gt;<i> more embedded systems with the book as VMware virtual machines that 
</I>&gt;<i> people can boot up and play with on their own computer. No extra 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware required! Then we'll point them to www.peeweelinux.com.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I've never tried vmware - I saw it demo'ed at Linux World Expo and it looked
great -  but I don't have anything faster than 400MHz/128Mb Ram. 
Actually using it with Linux should be a big help.  

However, after the demo, people are going to want to port it to some box
somewhere - it would be neat to have some recommended motherboards (and
associated drivers) for &quot;instant embedding&quot;.  These would be simple, small (20K
or so) pwlconfig project files. Of course, thats a lot more work too...but I
wouldn't claim to be &quot;embedded&quot; without gett'n in the hardware at some point.

(Thanks for the pointer!)
Later,
Ralph
