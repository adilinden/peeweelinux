<PRE>Thanks guys.  Installed it and it worked great.

I looked at a copy of Red Hat 6.1 but it is using the 2.2.12 kernel 
and PeeWeeLinux 0.51 shipped with 2.2.14. Have you moved up to 6.2?

What do I need to do to compile the sources? The documentation says 
that I need Red Hat installed but not much else besides that. Has 
anyone patched PWL with RTLinux or RTAI? Do you need a hand with the 
documentation or anything? I don't have much spare time but I could 
expand on the docs that you have as I'm learning.

I'm currently writing about building embedded systems with LabVIEW 
and Linux for Gary W. Johnson and Richard T. Jennings &quot;LabVIEW 
Graphical Programming, 3 rd Edition&quot; to be published early next year. 
I'm really excited about PeeWeeLinux because you guys made something 
hard into something pretty easy. You still need to be knowledgeable 
about how Linux works but PWL takes a _lot_ of the work out of 
trimming down or building up an embedded system.

We're going to try to show people how easy it is to build an embedded 
system using LabVIEW, Linux and VMware.  We plan on shipping one or 
more embedded systems with the book as VMware virtual machines that 
people can boot up and play with on their own computer. No extra 
hardware required! Then we'll point them to www.peeweelinux.com.

What do you think?

Richard
