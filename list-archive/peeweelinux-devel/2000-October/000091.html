That's certainly a problem, and one which grows out of the kernel's
monolithic architecture. The best you can do is make everything that
might be optional a module, as you suggest below.

</I>
Nor even desirable, necessarily. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another option would be to reduce the number of special purpose kernels
</I>&gt;<i> and insead build a highly modularized kernel with virtually all options.
</I>&gt;<i> Very similar to the stock RedHat kernel.
</I>
An embedded systems designer would have the same advantages that Red Hat
has, too: by putting a selection of modules, not all of which are always
needed, on a compressed initrd the final kernel RAM footprint might be
a bit smaller.

&gt;<i>                                          It would be up to the individual

Eeks! Anyone writing drivers, especially file system modules, could have
some heartburn over this. The kernel guys make radical changes to the
VFS
layer more often than some people change socks, and of course don't 
document them. Going from 2.2 to 2.4 is reportedly not so traumatic as
2.0 to 2.2, but still...defer the pain if you can.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments would be quite welcome here :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another feature still in the works is a dependency checking routine in
</I>&gt;<i> pwlconfig. I had one figured out and added it to one of the pwl_target
</I>&gt;<i> (rd_functions) but never completed it. I used to have depended libs as

</I>-
That reminds me of a feature that one of commercial embedded distros
has.
Embeddix, I think. They have a utility which can look at an executable
--or maybe a set of executables--which you propose to put in your target
system, then construct a custom library containing only the stuff you
really need. I think that's how it works. For good reason they call it
'lipo'. I've been trying to figure out how they do that. 'ldd' can tell
you which libs an executable needs, but not which routines in the libs
it links to.

You guys have a nice piece of work here in pwl. I wish the time demands
of
my current project had let me lend a hand. Good show!
