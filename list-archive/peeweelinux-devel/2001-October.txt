Subject: Ramdisk,Kylix and PeeWee Linux
Message-ID: <200110040324.AA11272264@mail.powerhosts.net>

Hello,
I am using the last version of PeeWee Linux for to embed a system for to use in our Kiosk's.

The system is working on a 48 MB Disk On Module and the application which needs to run on it is developed with Kylix.

Here is the problems i am experiencing :

1-) I cannot use ramdisk which exceeds 40 mb ram (the ramdisk image in disk on module is about 12 mb compressed)

2-) The application developed with Kylix is not working properly on PeeWee Linux while it was working great with our development platform (fully installed Redhat 7.0, Kylix). The problem is i am not able to see texts when i run program on PeeWee Linux (labels, custom error messages etc. none of them displayed when the program is running under PeeWee Linux)

Can someone give me an idea about how can i solve these problems ?

Thanks,

Alper Atay

Hi,

Is the application you're running X-based or terminal based?

Redhat 7.0 uses different libraries than Redhat 6.2 which is the basis of
PeeWeeLinux. You may be experiencing problems due to incompatible
libraries.

Adi

Hi,
The application is developed for X, the window manager in the RH 7.0 system is Gnome (dont know if this makes any sense).
I modified some libs with their newer versions, but cannot find the lib which causes that problem. Another problem since the ramdisk size is 30 mb i cannot add anything else to PeeWee Linux, and i don't know how to solve this problem since i am not sure if there is any ramdisk size limitation, or why am i experiencing that limitation. PeeWee Linux is booting and giving kernel in panic error while trying to mount the root system, or simply locking the machine while trying to boot it when my ramdisk image is bigger than 30 mb.

Subject: [Peeweelinux-devel] read-only system
Message-ID: <3BD41CD6.6000203@haptica.com>

Has anyone any experience with read-only filesystems..
I created a small peeweelinux filesystem and put it on a
compact flash disk and made it readonly and I can telnet in

I get this problem:

Escape character is '^]'.
telnetd: All network ports in use.
Connection closed by foreign host.

And telnet works ok if I have the /dev directory read-write??

I have created read-only filesystems before and never had this
problem, anyone any ideas?

Hi,

My experiance has been that the device directory has to be read-write for
an write access to devices to succeed. Even though, writing to the devices
won't result in anything being written to the underlying filesystem. I'd
be very interested in hearing if it's possible to write to the devices on
a read-only filesystem.

I've just got it to work... after about 6 hours!!!

I just tried changing the system to look like the cut down red hat version
I done previously so I changed the inetd.conf telnet line to
........ /usr/sbin/tcpd in.telnetd

and then added the none /dev/pts ...... line to fstab and done a
mount /dev/pts on boot up

so when a telnet request comes in if you check inside the /dev/pts
folder a new pseuso device is created (even with readonly filesystem)

But I've been using readonly filesystems for a while now and never
had any problem with write access to mounted ram disks or serial lines.

Only sort of problem left which isnt really a problem for me is that
when init runs the mingetty consoles.. it never works with the system
readonly and I used to make the system read-write for that small time
while mingetty created the login prompt but I dont need it now.
So the init script only runs /bin/sh as I dont really use the system as a
terminal only as a login box, which is why I needed telnet working on the
device!

Adi, my experience is the same as yours and Derek's. I was working with
a client to develop a product using a read-only cramfs file system
on a flash cartridge. We wound up making /dev a symlink to /initrd/dev,
and put the "real" device nodes in the dev directory of a persistent
initrd. Rather inconvenient, but we needed the initrd anyway so not
too bad.

Hi Dennis,

Apparently the 2.4 kernel supports a virtual device filesystem similar to
the way the /proc filesystem works. I hope to add a 2.4 kernel soon and
take advantage of that kernel feature.

1.My kernel should support the RAMDISK?
2.what is the user and passward of user login? How to
