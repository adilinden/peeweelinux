Subject: [Peeweelinux-devel] How do I make a Linux Syetem for ARM ?
Message-ID: <3C6AA0972BC.E117GORIALIU@smtp.giga.net.tw>

Hello, Everyone :

This is Goria.Liu., come from Taiwan.
Today is my first day to use PeeWeeLinux. I had built a small x86
bootable system in floppy. ( use the example : minimal)

I hope to create a Linux system for ARM. But I don't know how to do this
work. How to change the HAL by using PeeWeeLinux ?

Could anyone kindly give me some advices ?


Best Regards,

Goria.Liu.

Message-ID: <OF6500ED09.0192DC13-ON4A256B60.00812967@juptech.com>

Hi all, 

We currently use Peewee to create auto-installing CDs for client Servers, 
works a charm - love the way peewee is put together.

Our next project invlolves creating a very (very) trim linux install for 
use in a terminal, However, we need to use the 2.4 series kernel
for this particular project.

We are looking at rebuilding peewee for a 2.4.8 kernel, and my question(s) 
is/are - 

1. Has anyone begun this already ?
2. Does anyone have any tips that they would like to share ? :)

I have spent a fair amount of time, googling, and reading the peewee mail 
list archives, but unfortunately, to date I have not found any indication 
that
any is starting (has started/completed) this.


Kind Regards, 

Delaney

Delaney,

I have been using Peewee Linux with the 2.4.17 kernel (DiskOnChip with open
source MTD drivers), installing the kernel using the "Custom Files" options
available under the "Configure File System" menu.

I just posted a message to the other (general discussion) Peewee mailing
list detailing how this was done.  As I said in that message, this may not
be the "best way" to do this, but it has worked well thus far.

I'm not sure what Adi's long term plans are for handling "custom" kernels,
but I've found that creating my own custom image (completely separate from
Peewee), and then adding it to the custom files directory has worked
extremely well.  The real power (IMHO) of Peewee is the package selection,
automatic partitioning/formatting of the target, and flexible target
options.

Regards,

Mark

Hi Mark, thanks for your response, 

This is exactly the approach that we have used to date.
I friend of mine has contacted Adi (love your work) - who has said he is 
not planning to move peewee to the 2.4 series at the moment - mainly 
because the
2.2-17 kernel is rock solid and the 2.4.* kernels aren't, yet :) 

What I should have said is, we are looking to move  the entire peewee 
package, libraries, packages etc to 2.4 and glibc 2.2(?)
I agree that the power of peewee is in it's "automation" of selection and 
preparation - it's just that we are looking to move it along from the
2.2 series and older version of glibc (and all associated goods and 
shattles)

Kind Regards, 
Delaney

Delaney,

My apologies for misunderstanding your question.  I wasn't sure if you meant
just the kernel, or all of the packages, libraries, etc.

I certainly understand the need to update to 2.4 kernels, but it's not
completely obvious to me why the latest revisions of gcc/glibc are
important.  I've been using the glibc 2.1.x compatibility packages (under
Redhat 7.2) for development, and I haven't come across any problems so far.

Am I missing something?  Do the latest versions offer any major advantages
for embedded systems development?

Regards,

Mark

Hi Mark, sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

To my knowledge, know that later versions do not offer any significant 
advantages over the newer libraries (except the obvious size savings).

Currently our developer's are using Mandrake linux 8.1 - some initial 
reasons we were looking at later packages/libraries/kernels etc for peewee
is that :

1) we wanted the live running environment to match the development 
environment, as closely as possible, rather than having to perform some 
weird configuration juggling to ensure all ~12 developers are working from 
the same base, and that that the base dev setup and live setup match

As a note (I haven't looked into this yet ) some of the tools they use 
(e.g. GTK2) I would have thought would need the later libraries to run - 
if this is the case rather than mixing and matching libraries from 
different versions, we'd prefer to use the one set of libs.

2) The hardware guys want the USB support that the 2.4 kernel offers. 
While the 2.2 series can be patched to add USB support, that's (for 
reasons of their own) not the path the want to take.


I had not heard of the glibc compatibility packages - they sound like they 
may be worth a look - thanks for the tip.


I hope you can extract some sense from the above ramblings, 
I really need a coke right about now :)

Kind Regards, 
Delaney

Hi Delaney,

Thanks for your response.  Library (in)compatibilities were causing me some grief early
on, and I'm still trying to sort out all the details.

FWIW, the compatibility packages really helped.  I have a Redhat 7.2 system for
development, and using these packages allowed me to compile and link my applications
against the shared libraries used in the current release of Peewee Linux.  This, of
course, made my applications *much* smaller (no longer statically linked).

I'm not sure how it's done with Mandrake, but in Redhat 7.2 it was simply installing some
.rpm packages:

compat-glibc-6.2-2.1.3.2
compat-egcs-6.2-1.1.2.16
compat-libs-6.2-3
compat-libstdc++-6.2-2.9

After installing these packages, running a script called "i386-glibc21-linux-env.sh"
allowed me to link all my applications against glibc 2.1.x libraries.

Regards,

Mark

Hi,

Has anyone created any packages for PeeWeeLinux?

I am working on some updated and new packages. Back when I had choosen rpm
as a package maintenance tool. I don't remember why. The pwlconfig
scripts deal entirely with tar files. The only time rpm comes into play
is when the rpm files are extracted into tar files.

I wonder if it would be easier to do away with rpm and use shell scripts
to generate PeeWeeLinux packages?

Any suggestions?

Adi

Hi Adi,

I am not sure that all binary packages come in tar
format. For example, Samba. Sure the source is tar.gz
but looking at the binary i found the .rpm is upto
date. So ditching rpm entirely could be difficult.

Just a thought.

Hi Rick,

The pwlconfig script converts the rpm to a tar archive and
deals just with the tar file from then on.

I remember one of the reasons for going rpm, it a neat way
to keep all patches and sources required in a neat package.
Not sure if that couldn't be accomplished with clever
directory tree jsut the same...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0202270034020.16233-100000@big.adis.on.ca>

Hi,

This is just a minor update. Pwlconfig relies on the lxdialog binary to
create and display its graphical interface. The lxdialog supplied with pre
0.61.1 version was dynamically linked and doesn't work out of the box with
some Linux distribution, notably distributions newer than RedHat 6.2.

This release included a copy of the lxdialog sources from the kernel
source tree. The lxdialog binary is no build the first time pwlconfig is
run on a system. This makes PeeWeeLinux easier to use on Linux installs
with ncurses5.

If you have a working 0.61.0 install, there won't be any benefit in
upgrading to 0.61.1!

Regards,
Adi
