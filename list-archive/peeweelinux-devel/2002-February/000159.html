<PRE>Hi all, 

We currently use Peewee to create auto-installing CDs for client Servers, 
works a charm - love the way peewee is put together.

Our next project invlolves creating a very (very) trim linux install for 
use in a terminal, However, we need to use the 2.4 series kernel
for this particular project.

We are looking at rebuilding peewee for a 2.4.8 kernel, and my question(s) 
is/are - 

1. Has anyone begun this already ?
2. Does anyone have any tips that they would like to share ? :)

I have spent a fair amount of time, googling, and reading the peewee mail 
list archives, but unfortunately, to date I have not found any indication 
that
any is starting (has started/completed) this.


Kind Regards, 

Delaney
