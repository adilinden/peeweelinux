<PRE>Hi Mark, sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

To my knowledge, know that later versions do not offer any significant 
advantages over the newer libraries (except the obvious size savings).

Currently our developer's are using Mandrake linux 8.1 - some initial 
reasons we were looking at later packages/libraries/kernels etc for peewee
is that :

1) we wanted the live running environment to match the development 
environment, as closely as possible, rather than having to perform some 
weird configuration juggling to ensure all ~12 developers are working from 
the same base, and that that the base dev setup and live setup match

As a note (I haven't looked into this yet ) some of the tools they use 
(e.g. GTK2) I would have thought would need the later libraries to run - 
if this is the case rather than mixing and matching libraries from 
different versions, we'd prefer to use the one set of libs.

2) The hardware guys want the USB support that the 2.4 kernel offers. 
While the 2.2 series can be patched to add USB support, that's (for 
reasons of their own) not the path the want to take.


I had not heard of the glibc compatibility packages - they sound like they 
may be worth a look - thanks for the tip.


I hope you can extract some sense from the above ramblings, 
I really need a coke right about now :)

Kind Regards, 
Delaney

Delaney,

My apologies for misunderstanding your question.  I wasn't sure if you 
meant
just the kernel, or all of the packages, libraries, etc.

I certainly understand the need to update to 2.4 kernels, but it's not
completely obvious to me why the latest revisions of gcc/glibc are
important.  I've been using the glibc 2.1.x compatibility packages (under
Redhat 7.2) for development, and I haven't come across any problems so 
far.

Am I missing something?  Do the latest versions offer any major advantages
for embedded systems development?

Regards,

Mark

&gt;<i> Hi Mark, thanks for your response,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is exactly the approach that we have used to date.
</I>&gt;<i> I friend of mine has contacted Adi (love your work) - who has said he is
</I>&gt;<i> not planning to move peewee to the 2.4 series at the moment - mainly
</I>&gt;<i> because the
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2-17 kernel is rock solid and the 2.4.* kernels aren't, yet :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I should have said is, we are looking to move  the entire peewee
</I>&gt;<i> package, libraries, packages etc to 2.4 and glibc 2.2(?)
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that the power of peewee is in it's &quot;automation&quot; of selection 
</I>and
&gt;<i> preparation - it's just that we are looking to move it along from the
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2 series and older version of glibc (and all associated goods and
</I>&gt;<i> shattles)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Delaney
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
