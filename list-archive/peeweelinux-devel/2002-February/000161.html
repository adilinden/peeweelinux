<PRE>Hi Mark, thanks for your response, 

This is exactly the approach that we have used to date.
I friend of mine has contacted Adi (love your work) - who has said he is 
not planning to move peewee to the 2.4 series at the moment - mainly 
because the
2.2-17 kernel is rock solid and the 2.4.* kernels aren't, yet :) 

What I should have said is, we are looking to move  the entire peewee 
package, libraries, packages etc to 2.4 and glibc 2.2(?)
I agree that the power of peewee is in it's &quot;automation&quot; of selection and 
preparation - it's just that we are looking to move it along from the
2.2 series and older version of glibc (and all associated goods and 
shattles)

Kind Regards, 
Delaney

      Project: 


Delaney,

I have been using Peewee Linux with the 2.4.17 kernel (DiskOnChip with 
open
source MTD drivers), installing the kernel using the &quot;Custom Files&quot; 
options
available under the &quot;Configure File System&quot; menu.

I just posted a message to the other (general discussion) Peewee mailing
list detailing how this was done.  As I said in that message, this may not
be the &quot;best way&quot; to do this, but it has worked well thus far.

I'm not sure what Adi's long term plans are for handling &quot;custom&quot; kernels,
but I've found that creating my own custom image (completely separate from
Peewee), and then adding it to the custom files directory has worked
extremely well.  The real power (IMHO) of Peewee is the package selection,
automatic partitioning/formatting of the target, and flexible target
options.

Regards,

Mark

&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> We currently use Peewee to create auto-installing CDs for client

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Has anyone begun this already ?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Does anyone have any tips that they would like to share ? :)
