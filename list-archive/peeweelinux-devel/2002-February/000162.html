<PRE>Delaney,

My apologies for misunderstanding your question.  I wasn't sure if you meant
just the kernel, or all of the packages, libraries, etc.

I certainly understand the need to update to 2.4 kernels, but it's not
completely obvious to me why the latest revisions of gcc/glibc are
important.  I've been using the glibc 2.1.x compatibility packages (under
Redhat 7.2) for development, and I haven't come across any problems so far.

Am I missing something?  Do the latest versions offer any major advantages
for embedded systems development?

Regards,

Mark

&gt;<i> Hi Mark, thanks for your response,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is exactly the approach that we have used to date.
</I>&gt;<i> I friend of mine has contacted Adi (love your work) - who has said he is
</I>&gt;<i> not planning to move peewee to the 2.4 series at the moment - mainly
</I>&gt;<i> because the
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2-17 kernel is rock solid and the 2.4.* kernels aren't, yet :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I should have said is, we are looking to move  the entire peewee
</I>&gt;<i> package, libraries, packages etc to 2.4 and glibc 2.2(?)
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that the power of peewee is in it's &quot;automation&quot; of selection and
</I>&gt;<i> preparation - it's just that we are looking to move it along from the
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2 series and older version of glibc (and all associated goods and
</I>&gt;<i> shattles)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Delaney
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
