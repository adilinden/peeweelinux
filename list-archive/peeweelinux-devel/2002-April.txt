Subject: [Peeweelinux-devel] reiserfs on peeweelinux
Message-ID: <20020408124801.19049.qmail@daitarn.register.it>

Hi everybody!
For a project I'm currently on charge of, I need to install a linux with very small footprint AND a journalised fs.
At the end, I decided to adopt peeweelinux because it seems much more flexible than other tiny distributions, and ReiserFS because its seems the best around so far.
Here is the strategy I plan to apply, I would like to receive your comments and share experiences:

1) apply the ReiserFS 3.5.28 for kernel 2.2.17
2) slightly modify the PW scripts in order to create a Reiser partition instead of an ext2 (I am developing on a DOM that acts as an IDE disk).

Should 3.5.28 prove itself unstable for some reasons, I could apply a different strategy:

1) upgrade PWL kernel to 2.2.19 applying the appropriate patches
2) apply the ReiserFS 3.5.34 for kernel 2.2.19
3) modify scripts as said before.

What do you think of this? Suggestions? Better methods? Deja-vu? ;-)
tks
  Giuseppe
