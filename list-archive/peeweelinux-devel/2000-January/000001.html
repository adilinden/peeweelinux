<PRE>Hi Ralph,

Hey, you're subscribed to the wrong mailing list. I asked the fellas at
source forge to remove the 2 lists but they haven't done that. I am
hosting a couple of lists on my own server.

So, the lists are:

<A HREF="mailto:PeeWeeLinux@adis.on.ca">PeeWeeLinux@adis.on.ca</A>
<A HREF="mailto:PeeWeeLinux-devel@adis.on.ca">PeeWeeLinux-devel@adis.on.ca</A>

I added your name to the list members so you should be getting content
automatically. I know about the issue with the 'reply-to' field. However,
I still chosse to use it. That insures all replies default to go back to
the list. Also, otherwise most replies will be send in duplicate, ont to
the list the other to the sender.

I've been really busy this past week. We've had major server problems at
work. I am suspecting the damage was done purposely and not accidental
hardware or software failure. Two boxes died within a week with identical
symptoms. Turns out when I upgraded the boxes to RedHat 6.0 from Redhat
5.2 I missed to rewrite the firewall from ipfwadm to ipchains. At least my
box might have been save then. Oh well...

Sooo... I got the routers going and discovered a bug in Helius Network
Edition for DirecPC. Spend a 5 hours trying to find out what I was doing
wrong until I came to the conclusion that their version for RedHat 6.0 is
slightly defective. It's a major stumbling block for some communities as
it means sending their existing equipment in to have a router build. Which
will mean no Internet for at least 3 days. The problem has to do with the
initial configuration of the system. There are no runtime problems.  Other
than that it's working perfectly!

Still haven't had time to work on my par time project the was the original
puch to create PeeWeeLinux. I have orders for my little LAN dialup
embedded box but haven't begun to build it yet... Don't have name for it
either. PeeWeeRouter maybe? Then build a PeeWeeKiosk and a PeeWeePlayer...
:<i>)
</I>
Hey, you could have me play with a IPIX to build a kiosk and share my
development work with you for use in your work, make it boot, run from a
ramdisk, etc... :)

&gt;<i> &gt; I am just thinking about adding descriptions to packages. There are a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number of available kernel packages available. It would be nice to be able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to access a &lt;Help&gt; screen or &lt;Info&gt; screen giving a description of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packages. Especially if theres a bunch of similar stuff to choose from...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The help button easily supports context sensitive help.  When help is 
</I>&gt;<i> selected, the menu item currently highlighted is returned also.  
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, the help file must contain this menu item somewhere/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that a common file in each package subdirectory should be used
</I>&gt;<i> to contain the help information about that package.  Just off the top...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> README.&lt;packagename&gt;
</I>
There could be 2 ways to do this:

README.&lt;packagename&gt; - or -
&lt;packagename&gt;.README

The last solution would have the advantage that the file would be listed
with the package when doing an ls rather than first all README's and then
all packages.

&gt;<i> or something like this, not sure if there is any &quot;standard&quot;....
</I>&gt;<i> I can use sed to parse whatever text is following a &quot;key word&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> display that in a dialog box (just like I'm parsing the README.pwlconfig
</I>&gt;<i> file now).  By keeping the help screen in the package directory, all 
</I>&gt;<i> information about that package is maintained within that directory.
</I>
So what would be suitable keywords?

Description:
Dependencies:
Compilation:

&gt;<i> Sorry for the delay...I'll try to catch up with other e-mail now
</I>
No problem... It gets pretty darn busy sometimes!

I am working on adding a couple more packages. I need to add Minicom to
the router. And there is a small login package available now. It could
replace util-linux for very small applications requiring authentication.
Also, I need a webserver for doing configuration of the router. I am
thinking about adding boa. It seems quite stable and lean on memory
requirements, etc. It does support cgi, though. A must for doing any
configuration via a webserver, I think.

I can do cgi on my sourceforge shell account. I am intending to write a
little perl script to ease uploading file to source forge. Something
that'll use wget to download to sourceforge with retry and then uses
ncftput to place it in the incoming directory on sourceforge. If I ftp
straight from here it usually times out. There are certain places where
the connection from here isn't too hot....  

TTYL,
Adi
