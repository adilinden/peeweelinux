Hey,
Couldn't get time to do the e-mail thing today...I wrote another 500 or so
lines of script to get the pwl_default thing working.  Also split up the
script files some more, things are getting pretty clean now...

Now that I have started parameterizing the &quot;default&quot; stuff in pwlconfig, I've
gotten about 10 parameters.  This should come in handy somewhere down the
road...

BTW, I added the items I'm working on as &quot;new features&quot; in the source forge bug
tracking stuff.  I got some mail from source forge about the mail server not
being enabled...might have a link that needs fixing here to get source forge to
send bug announcements to your mail server.  Thats just a guess...

more...

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I downloaded the 0.19 source file today (pretty good response for downloads
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from sourceforge...haven't tried your new ftp yet). Looks like a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in there..not sure what it all is though...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are still duplicate sources in there. The originals and the
</I>&gt;<i> extracted, modified, comiled ones for PWL. I only patched boa so far. I
</I>&gt;<i> have to work throught the other ones too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still need to decide wether to do the tar thing or use rpm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I like the tar thing for now. I maybe we could re-visit this after we figure
out what to do with the packages and ram disk stuff.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; I started on the next release of pwlconfig.  I've integrated it so it can
</I>&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my &quot;mkBootDevice&quot; shell script, now I just have to add a few parameters to
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project.  So far I can only come up with a handfull of &quot;project&quot; specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parameters, but I'm planning on a menu that will let you enter these items
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a &quot;...projects/myproject/project.default&quot; file. (you can manually edit it
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use the menus).  Adding more parameters anytime should be a breeze...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;From Main Menu-&gt;Manage project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Project Device Type: DOC&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Project Device Location: /dev/fla1&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Project Mount Point: ./mnt&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Boot Label: pwlboot&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;File System Compressed: no&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Default source for custom files: /home/ralph/SRC&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;&lt;suggestions ???&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cursor through these items and select them to change them.  Its a little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overhead (script coding) to provide an interactive menu, but it keeps all
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pwl stuff integrated in the pwlconfig script.  I think I'll keep these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functions in a small script, like &quot;pwl_default&quot;, that gets called by
</I>&gt;<i> pwlconfig
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or from the command line.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So thi would allow for a configuration to be 'totally' configured with
</I>&gt;<i> pwlconfig, where the projects files go, where the temp mount point is?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yep, added that one too..thanks...

&gt;<i> &gt; I split out some of the utility functions to shorten the pwlconfig script
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also to share these between the scripts.  Small sharp tools and all that...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After this release, I'll start on integrating the &quot;build package&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scripts...then what ?? The compressed file system should be good challenge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too...almost forgot about that one...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, of the main menu there should be a configuration section to set
</I>&gt;<i> whatever parameter for the project. Another main section should be the
</I>&gt;<i> package selection portion and extraction of these files to the configured
</I>&gt;<i> mount point. The next major meu item should be about what to with the
</I>&gt;<i> build filesystem, i.e. load a DOC or flash, create  a ramdisk, iso image,
</I>&gt;<i> tar file, etc...   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'll look at your next e-mail to try to figure more of this out...


&gt;<i> &gt; Probably need to start building a couple of default projects..once users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download the binaries, they should be able to download &quot;router&quot;, &quot;thin
</I>&gt;<i> client&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and so on - maybe 5-10K each - or the &quot;Project of the Month&quot;.  Since I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gotten anything to work yet, I can't help here :-(  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, I fried a DOC. Don't know how I did it, but if I boot my development
</I>&gt;<i> system on the embedded box I get a kernel message 'cannot access
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/fla...'. I tried using the dos tools to restore it to a DOS disk with
</I>&gt;<i> the original boot sector. It tells me it is not a FFS device. I s there
</I>&gt;<i> warranty on these???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I sent you an extra chip incase you wanted to play with that on IPIX...
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Best thing to do is see if you can build one of your working projects just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using pwlconfig...that should be a good test :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, planning on doing that with the dialin box. Also, plan on doing this
</I>&gt;<i> for the satellite router as part of doing the documentation of how to
</I>&gt;<i> build it. It's sometimes a pain to do docs and decide what knowledge the
</I>&gt;<i> reader should have (in how much detail to go).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, I tried your generate_list script (after I noticed that my &quot;include
</I>&gt;<i> all&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wasn't working since there were no list files to include).  It kept killing
</I>&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; xterm window...so, I played with it...(hacker mentality - not my code, it
</I>&gt;<i> must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be tweaked!;-) and add a &quot;--remove&quot; function...and set it up to work from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either directory (Embedded_Build or Embedded_Build/scripts). I'll post it
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good stuff, I am considering myself a beginner when it comes to perl and
</I>&gt;<i> shell scripts. I think bacause I didn't formally learn it I missing some
</I>&gt;<i> basics but at the same time know a lot of adavanced stuff because of all
</I>&gt;<i> the other programming stuff I did. I am still having a bit of a hard time
</I>&gt;<i> with having the script determine how it was invoked and where it live.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The `pwd` command would give you the location from where the script was
</I>&gt;<i> started. The '$0' variable includes the path and script name to get to the
</I>&gt;<i> script from the 'pwd' location. Maybe using these 2 it would be possible
</I>&gt;<i> to jump to predefined starting point?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>or you can look in the current directory to see if the script is there or in
another directory...depends on what you want to do.
