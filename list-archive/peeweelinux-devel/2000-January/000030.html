<PRE>Hi Ralph,

&gt;<i> Now that I have started parameterizing the &quot;default&quot; stuff in pwlconfig, I've
</I>&gt;<i> gotten about 10 parameters.  This should come in handy somewhere down the
</I>&gt;<i> road...
</I>
Perhaps makes future changes easier! I am getting better at using lots of
variables. Defining everything and define most things right at the
beginning of the script. Like doing assembler...

&gt;<i> BTW, I added the items I'm working on as &quot;new features&quot; in the source forge bug
</I>&gt;<i> tracking stuff.  I got some mail from source forge about the mail server not
</I>&gt;<i> being enabled...might have a link that needs fixing here to get source forge to
</I>&gt;<i> send bug announcements to your mail server.  Thats just a guess...
</I>
Hmmm... got to look at that. My 'boss' likes my mailing list so much, he
wants it too. So I ended up searching for a web frontend for majordomo. I
found majorcool. Well, it's cool :) Just in case you're into this stuff,
it's at <A HREF="http://adis.on.ca/cgi-bin/majorcool">http://adis.on.ca/cgi-bin/majorcool</A>

I don't think it's a good idea to have Windoze user administer mailing
list config files as root on a linux system. Who knows what they get
into...

&gt;<i> I like the tar thing for now. I maybe we could re-visit this after we figure
</I>&gt;<i> out what to do with the packages and ram disk stuff.
</I>
Good stuff. So we will stick with it. I think it has more potential for
making it platform independent than rpm. Plus, PWL will likely include
quite a few packages that are not part of the RedHat distribution.

&gt;<i> &gt; Yup, I fried a DOC. Don't know how I did it, but if I boot my development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system on the embedded box I get a kernel message 'cannot access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /dev/fla...'. I tried using the dos tools to restore it to a DOS disk with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the original boot sector. It tells me it is not a FFS device. I s there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; warranty on these???
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I sent you an extra chip incase you wanted to play with that on IPIX...
</I>
Either flash or DOC should work fine...

&gt;<i> or you can look in the current directory to see if the script is there or in
</I>&gt;<i> another directory...depends on what you want to do.
</I>
Hey, that's a great way to do errorchecking and not run the script if the
current directory is wrong... hmmmm...

TTYL,
Adi
