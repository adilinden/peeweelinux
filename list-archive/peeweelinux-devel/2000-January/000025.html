<PRE>Hi Ralph,

I am just going through running pwlconfig. It needs lxdialog. And the help
message or error message is a bit inaccurate, at least for my system:

[<A HREF="mailto:root@big">root@big</A> Embedded_Build]# ./pwlconfig 
Utility program &quot;lxdialog&quot; not found
( do make Menuconfig and copy from /usr/src/linux/lxdialog )
[<A HREF="mailto:root@big">root@big</A> Embedded_Build]# cp /usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog/lxdialog
scripts/
 
The location is where lxdialog is located is a bit further into the source
tree... Is lxdialog machine dependent? Couldn't we include a lxdialog for
ease of use?

This is the existing menu:

      Configure Project File System ---&gt;
      Extract File System for Project ---&gt;
      ----
      Erase Disk-On-Chip ---&gt;
      Load File System onto Disk-On-Chip ---&gt;
      Install LInux LOader (LILO) to Disk-On-Chip
      ----
      Save Project
      Manage Projects ---&gt;                                     

And some ideas of how to change things:

The first 2 are fine, selecting what to use and extracting it into a spare
directory.

I think the next 3 could be submenued to facilitate dealing with different
options like Disk-On-Chip, ramdisk, bootable iso... Like this:

      ---
      Uncompressed filesystem on Disk-On-Chip
      Compressed filesystem
      Bootable ramdisk system
      Bootable iso image
      ---

The first item would contain all the DOC specific stuff. The second item
would create a tar.gz file from the files located in the temporary mount
directory.

The ramdisk section could be something like this:

      ---
      Create ramdisk
      Create bootable filesystem w/syslinux
      ---      

      The first step would create the ramdisk image. The second step would
      create a filesystem including all files necessary to boot the
      ramdisk using syslinux from a FAT12 or FAT 16 formatted disk
      partition.

And the fourth part would do just that. An iso image that can be processed
by any burner...

What exactly does the &quot;save Projects&quot; step do? Would it be possible to
create a menu item that saves (tgz) all the files that make up a
configured project to make it portable and drop into a furure release of
pwlconfig and PWL?

Coming to think of it, there aren't that many options, perhaps everything
could stay on the main page just devided by the little '---' ?

One last thought about the rpm vs tar issue...

rpm uses a .rpmrc file. With it its supposed to be possible to totally
configure rpm. Directories where to build and extract file systems, etc.
I'll be playing with it for a bit, too.

The patch I did for boa is an idea to play with. I don't think its
necessarily the best solution. rpm has a lot for it, too.

TTYL,
Adi
