<PRE>Hi Ralph,

&gt;<i> Ok, this is a bit of a mess :-(
</I>&gt;<i> There are 2 forums and 3 mailing list + 2 more mailing lists ? ...not to 
</I>&gt;<i> mention, I keep sending mail to myself about 3 times :-) As long as
</I>&gt;<i> I don't start replying to myself, I guess we're ok...
</I>
My fault, I originally setup the mailing lists on sourceforge. I made some
mistaks I couldn't fix and asked the sourceforge people to change it. So I
went and installed majordomo and ran mailing lists on my own box. I
intended to make the lists on sourcforge private, so noone can subscribe
or post messages... Also, last night I attempted to remove any names that
belong to the sourceforge lists. I hope it worked...

&gt;<i> BTW, did you seen the message about someone looking for the root
</I>&gt;<i> password ? I send a response direct from my poor ailing memory, you 
</I>&gt;<i> might be able to clarify this...I guess this means we've been spotted :-)
</I>
I entered a app record on freshmeat...


&gt;<i> No problem receiving mail...at least to this yahoo account...they just
</I>&gt;<i> gave me a new computer at work, pre-installed with Windows and IE which
</I>&gt;<i> should bring my work account back up.  then I just put everything on
</I>&gt;<i> a floppy and move it where I need it..unless it &gt;1.4MB...unless its on
</I>&gt;<i> my target...ahhhhhhhhhhhh
</I>
Fun stuff!

&gt;<i> Your work stuff getting in the way too ?? 
</I>
Yup, the problem is all is work and play. I love my job! Just the
priorities are screwed up. What I am supposed to do and what I'd like to
do any given moment doesn't quite match all the time. Ohhh well...

&gt;<i> &gt; Hey, you could have me play with a IPIX to build a kiosk and share my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development work with you for use in your work, make it boot, run from a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ramdisk, etc... :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not a problem...If you call Datalux and tell them what you're doing, they
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to send you an eval - tell them Ralph sent ya!  1-800-datalux
</I>&gt;<i> (free call !).
</I>
I'll give that a shot!

&gt;<i> Hmmm...not sure if we need to see them in this order, but it might be handy
</I>&gt;<i> for the user to move/add packages if all three files had same name:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _package.list
</I>&gt;<i> _package.tar
</I>&gt;<i> _package.README
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looks good to me...just need to know whats in a package but I can't help
</I>&gt;<i> you there..They're all just files to me!
</I>
So we'll stick with that...

&gt;<i> &gt; So what would be suitable keywords?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Description:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dependencies:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Compilation:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the keywords will have to be the package name, thats what I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> getting from the lxdialog when the help button is pressed. 
</I>&gt;<i> Just put it in the first column of the file...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #### _package.README 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> file history
</I>&gt;<i> ....
</I>&gt;<i> script to build from RPM..hint...hint.
</I>&gt;<i> .....
</I>&gt;<i> _base_filesystem 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;The best base file system package ever..described right here&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    ...text...all about the _base_filesystem
</I>&gt;<i>    shows up in the help screen until END is found...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> END
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> compile notes,
</I>&gt;<i> other notes that don't appear on help screen.
</I>&gt;<i> #####
</I>
#### minicom.README

Initial release, untested.

minicom

Minicom is a simple text-based modem control and terminal emulation
program somewhat similar to MSDOS Telix.  Minicom includes a dialing
directory, full ANSI and VT100 emulation, an (external) scripting
language, and other features.

END
####
 
Would the above be suitable? So it wouldn't need any other keywords? I
guess the package name shouldn't appear in the file history portion then.
The mods to 'fix' a RPM for PeeWeeLinux require a patch. I wonder if the
patch should be at the bottom of the README file? So put the compilation
and the patch output after the END statement?

&gt;<i> Or I can just dump the entire readme file to the help screen....
</I>
Depending on the contents that might be a lot to output...

&gt;<i> Cool, I couldn't get my V0.7 to load on source forge...hmmmm....maybe I can
</I>&gt;<i> mail it to myself on 3 or four mailing lists :-)))
</I>
Upload to <A HREF="ftp://download.sourceforge.net/incoming">ftp://download.sourceforge.net/incoming</A> then go to the admin
function of PeeWeeLinux and add the file...

I am having a very difficult time uploading to sourceforge. Basically it
doesn't work. SO now I login to the shell account, run wget to grab the
URL from my box... Once I think its done I login again and use ncftp to
transfer the file to the incoming directory. Then I go to the admin page
and finally add it.

So I want to do a cgi script that I can call like:
<A HREF="http://embedded.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/release.pl?file=embedded-0.19-src.tar.gz">http://embedded.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/release.pl?file=embedded-0.19-src.tar.gz</A>

It'll the do the above process and output a page saying it's all done once
it's done or send an email. Then I simply go to the admin page and add it
from there... Awkward process... 

&gt;<i> Its late again,
</I>
In the morning for me now :)

TTYL,
Adi
