<PRE>Adi,
I downloaded the 0.19 source file today (pretty good response for downloads
from sourceforge...haven't tried your new ftp yet). Looks like a lot of stuff
in there..not sure what it all is though...

I started on the next release of pwlconfig.  I've integrated it so it can use
my &quot;mkBootDevice&quot; shell script, now I just have to add a few parameters to the
project.  So far I can only come up with a handfull of &quot;project&quot; specific
parameters, but I'm planning on a menu that will let you enter these items into
a &quot;...projects/myproject/project.default&quot; file. (you can manually edit it or
use the menus).  Adding more parameters anytime should be a breeze...

&gt;<i>From Main Menu-&gt;Manage project
</I>&quot;Project Device Type: DOC&quot;
&quot;Project Device Location: /dev/fla1&quot;
&quot;Project Mount Point: ./mnt&quot;
&quot;Boot Label: pwlboot&quot;
&quot;File System Compressed: no&quot;
&quot;Default source for custom files: /home/ralph/SRC&quot;
&quot;&lt;suggestions ???&gt;&quot;

Cursor through these items and select them to change them.  Its a little
overhead (script coding) to provide an interactive menu, but it keeps all the
pwl stuff integrated in the pwlconfig script.  I think I'll keep these
functions in a small script, like &quot;pwl_default&quot;, that gets called by pwlconfig
or from the command line.

I split out some of the utility functions to shorten the pwlconfig script and
also to share these between the scripts.  Small sharp tools and all that...

Also, I plan on updating the help button to work for each package and fix the
bugs I've listed on sourceforge.  If you notice any &quot;unexpected features&quot; (ok,
bugs :-) list them there and I'll take a look at them.

After this release, I'll start on integrating the &quot;build package&quot;
scripts...then what ?? The compressed file system should be good challenge
too...almost forgot about that one...

Probably need to start building a couple of default projects..once users
download the binaries, they should be able to download &quot;router&quot;, &quot;thin client&quot;
and so on - maybe 5-10K each - or the &quot;Project of the Month&quot;.  Since I haven't
gotten anything to work yet, I can't help here :-(  

Best thing to do is see if you can build one of your working projects just
using pwlconfig...that should be a good test :-)

Later,
Ralph

BTW, I tried your generate_list script (after I noticed that my &quot;include all&quot;
wasn't working since there were no list files to include).  It kept killing my
xterm window...so, I played with it...(hacker mentality - not my code, it must
be tweaked!;-) and add a &quot;--remove&quot; function...and set it up to work from
either directory (Embedded_Build or Embedded_Build/scripts). I'll post it
