<PRE>Hi, how did we come up with the idea of using rpm instead of tar? Why not
use generic sources as it is done now? Just use those sources and create a
patch which would include a script which compiles and strips the binaries
and creates the package.tar file?

The only disadvantage would be that PeeWeeLinux would be rather large as a
source distribution. However, for normal operation of PeeWeeLinux the
sources wouldn't be required since only the binaries are processed into an
embedded sytem... This would eliminate the need to get totally involved
with rpm.

Here would be the process:

source.tgz  +  patch 1  +  patch x  +  PWL patch  =  PWL source
PWLsource processed by PWLbuild script (part of patch)  =  PWL binary.tgz

Again, i am not familiar with rpm as far as the building of binaries
from sources is concerned. But I would suspect the above would offer more
flexibility, I think. And allow us to easily keep everything within the
Embedded_Build directory tree... 

I think I should be changing al the package neames to include the version
numbers? What do you think?

TTYL,
Adi
