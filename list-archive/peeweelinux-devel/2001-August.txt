Adi,

A message from David Mackay (davidm@monitoreurope.com) called to my
attention that when we had the conversation below, I returned the
cramfs patch for the 2.2 kernel in a message exclusively to you,
rather than the entire pwl mailing list.

If you like, I can repost so everyone on the list gets it. Otherwise,
perhaps it could be made available in the downloads section of the
pwl web site. David couldn't find it, and I don't see it there either.

Regards,

  --Dennis

Hi,

Sorry about that! I uploaded the patch to the ftp server and it is now
available in the Contributed directory.

http://adis.on.ca/pub/Projects/Embedded/Contributed/cramfs.tgz

Integrating the cramfs patch into the kernel supplied with PeeWeeLinux is
on list of todos. Unfortunatley my work load, and the latest setback of a
week of high fever (chickenpox is no fun!), aren't helping in getting much
done on PeeWeeLinux.

Regards,
Adi Linden

Egad, man, chicken pox can be *seriously* bad news when it occurs in an
adult. I'm glad your recovering!!!!
