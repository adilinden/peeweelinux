Message-ID: <3E2DF1B3.204@davisnetworks.net>

I am seeking a quick and dirty way to add SSL/SSH support to PEEWEE 
Linux. I cant believe that this hasnt been done before yet and was 
wondering if anyone had any advice/RPMs. I dont feel like re-inventing 
the wheel and feel like this is the last step in getting my box to do 
what I want it to.

Thanks
Greg D Smith
